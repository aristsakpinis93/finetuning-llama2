Amazon Bedrock, currently available in preview, is a fully managed service that makes foundation models (FMs) from Amazon and leading AI startups—such as AI21 Labs, Anthropic, Cohere, and Stability AI—available through an API.\\nToday, I’m excited to announce the preview of agents for Amazon Bedrock, a new capability for developers to create fully managed agents in a few clicks. Agents for Amazon Bedrock accelerate the delivery of generative AI applications that can manage and perform tasks by making API calls to your company systems. Agents extend FMs to understand user requests, break down complex tasks into multiple steps, carry on a conversation to collect additional information, and take actions to fulfill the request.\\n\\nUsing agents for Amazon Bedrock, you can automate tasks for your internal or external customers, such as managing retail orders or processing insurance claims. For example, an agent-powered generative AI e-commerce application can not only respond to the question, “Do you have this jacket in blue?” with a simple answer but can also help you with the task of updating your order or managing an exchange.\\nFor this to work, you first need to give the agent access to external data sources and connect it to existing APIs of other applications. This allows the FM that powers the agent to interact with the broader world and extend its utility beyond just language processing tasks. Second, the FM needs to figure out what actions to take, what information to use, and in which sequence to perform these actions. This is possible thanks to an exciting emerging behavior of FMs—their ability to reason. You can show FMs how to handle such interactions and how to reason through tasks by building prompts that include definitions and instructions. The process of designing prompts to guide the model towards desired outputs is known as prompt engineering.\\nIntroducing Agents for Amazon Bedrock Agents for Amazon Bedrock automate the prompt engineering and orchestration of user-requested tasks. Once configured, an agent automatically builds the prompt and securely augments it with your company-specific information to provide responses back to the user in natural language. The agent is able to figure out the actions required to automatically process user-requested tasks. It breaks the task into multiple steps, orchestrates a sequence of API calls and data lookups, and maintains memory to complete the action for the user.\\nWith fully managed agents, you don’t have to worry about provisioning or managing infrastructure. You’ll have seamless support for monitoring, encryption, user permissions, and API invocation management without writing custom code. As a developer, you can use the Bedrock console or SDK to upload the API schema. The agent then orchestrates the tasks with the help of FMs and performs API calls using AWS Lambda functions.\\nPrimer on Advanced Reasoning and ReAct You can help FMs to reason and figure out how to solve user-requested tasks with a reasoning technique called ReAct (synergizing reasoning and acting). Using ReAct, you can structure prompts to show an FM how to reason through a task and decide on actions that help find a solution.\\xa0The structured prompts include a sequence of question-thought-action-observation examples.\\nThe question is the user-requested task or problem to solve. The thought is a reasoning step that helps demonstrate to the FM how to tackle the problem and identify an action to take. The action is an API that the model can invoke from an allowed set of APIs. The observation is the result of carrying out the action. The actions that the FM is able to choose from are defined by a set of instructions that are prepended to the example prompt text. Here is an illustration of how you would build up a ReAct prompt:\\n\\nThe good news is that Bedrock performs the heavy lifting for you! Behind the scenes, agents for Amazon Bedrock build the prompts based on the information and actions you provide.\\nNow, let me show you how to get started with agents for Amazon Bedrock.\\nCreate an Agent for Amazon Bedrock Let’s assume you’re a developer at an insurance company and want to provide a generative AI application that helps the insurance agency owners automate repetitive tasks. You create an agent in Bedrock and integrate it into your application.\\nTo get started with the agent, open the Bedrock console, select\\xa0Agents in the left navigation panel, then choose Create Agent.\\n\\nThis starts the agent creation workflow.\\n\\nProvide agent details including agent name, description (optional), whether the agent is allowed to request additional user inputs, and the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) service role that gives your agent access to other required services, such as Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) and AWS Lambda.\\nSelect a foundation model from Bedrock that fits your use case. Here, you provide an instruction to your agent in natural language. The instruction tells the agent what task it’s supposed to perform and the persona it’s supposed to assume. For example, “You are an agent designed to help with processing insurance claims and managing pending paperwork.”\\nAdd action groups. An action is a task that the agent can perform automatically by making API calls to your company systems. A set of actions is defined in an action group. Here, you provide an API schema that defines the APIs for all the actions in the group. You also must provide a Lambda function that represents the business logic for each API. For example, let’s define an action group called ClaimManagementActionGroup that manages insurance claims by pulling a list of open claims, identifying outstanding paperwork for each claim, and sending reminders to policy holders. Make sure to capture this information in the action group description. The business logic for my action group is captured in the Lambda function InsuranceClaimsLambda. This AWS Lambda function implements methods for the following API calls: open-claims, identify-missing-documents, and send-reminders.Here’s a short extract from my InsuranceClaimsLambda function: import json\\nimport time\\n \\ndef open_claims():\\n    ...\\n\\ndef identify_missing_documents(parameters):\\n    ...\\n \\ndef send_reminders():\\n    ...\\n \\ndef lambda_handler(event, context):\\n    responses = []\\n \\n    for prediction in event[\\'actionGroups\\']:\\n        response_code = ...\\n        action = prediction[\\'actionGroup\\']\\n        api_path = prediction[\\'apiPath\\']\\n        \\n        if api_path == \\'/claims\\':\\n            body = open_claims() \\n        elif api_path == \\'/claims/{claimId}/identify-missing-documents\\':\\n\\t\\t\\tparameters = prediction[\\'parameters\\']\\n            body = identify_missing_documents(parameters)\\n        elif api_path == \\'/send-reminders\\':\\n            body =  send_reminders()\\n        else:\\n            body = {\"{}::{} is not a valid api, try another one.\".format(action, api_path)}\\n \\n        response_body = {\\n            \\'application/json\\': {\\n                \\'body\\': str(body)\\n            }\\n        }\\n        \\n        action_response = {\\n            \\'actionGroup\\': prediction[\\'actionGroup\\'],\\n            \\'apiPath\\': prediction[\\'apiPath\\'],\\n            \\'httpMethod\\': prediction[\\'httpMethod\\'],\\n            \\'httpStatusCode\\': response_code,\\n            \\'responseBody\\': response_body\\n        }\\n        \\n        responses.append(action_response)\\n \\n    api_response = {\\'response\\': responses}\\n \\n    return api_response Note that you also must provide an API schema in the OpenAPI schema JSON format.

Bedrock then automatically creates a version for that alias.\\n\\nIn the Bedrock console, select your agent, then select Deploy, and choose Create to create an alias.\\nProvide an alias name and description and choose whether to create a new version or use an existing version of your agent to associate with this alias. \\nThis saves a snapshot of the agent code and configuration and associates an alias with this snapshot or version. You can use the alias to integrate the agent into your applications. \\n\\nNow, let’s test the insurance agent! You can do this right in the Bedrock console.\\nLet’s ask the agent to “Send reminder to all policy holders with open claims and pending paper work.” You can see how the FM-powered agent is able to understand the user request, break down the task into steps (collect the open insurance claims, lookup the claim IDs, send reminders), and perform the corresponding actions.\\n\\nAgents for Amazon Bedrock can help you increase productivity, improve your customer service experience, or automate DevOps tasks. I’m excited to see what use cases you will implement!\\nLearn the Fundamentals of Generative AI If you’re interested in the fundamentals of generative AI and how to work with FMs, including advanced prompting techniques and agents, check out this new hands-on course that I developed with AWS colleagues and industry experts in collaboration with DeepLearning.AI:\\nGenerative AI with large language models (LLMs) is an on-demand, three-week course for data scientists and engineers who want to learn how to build generative AI applications with LLMs. It’s the perfect foundation to start building with Amazon Bedrock.

Because information can be gathered in different ways, there is also the issue of different but equivalent data, such as for street addresses (“5th Avenue” and “5th Ave”). As a consequence, it’s not easy to link related records together to create a unified view and gain better insights.\\nFor example, companies want to run advertising campaigns to reach consumers across multiple applications and channels with personalized messaging. Companies often have to deal with disparate data records that contain incomplete or conflicting information, creating a difficult matching process.\\nIn the retail industry, companies have to reconcile, across their supply chain and stores, products that use multiple and different product codes, such as stock keeping units (SKUs), universal product codes (UPCs), or proprietary codes. This prevents them from analyzing information quickly and holistically.\\nOne way to address this problem is to build bespoke data resolution solutions such as complex SQL queries interacting with multiple databases, or train machine learning (ML) models for record matching. But these solutions take months to build, require development resources, and are costly to maintain.\\nTo help you with that, today we’re introducing AWS Entity Resolution, an ML-powered service that helps you match and link related records stored across multiple applications, channels, and data stores. You can get started in minutes configuring entity resolution workflows that are flexible, scalable, and can seamlessly connect to your existing applications.\\nAWS Entity Resolution offers advanced matching techniques, such as rule-based matching and machine learning models, to help you accurately link related sets of customer information, product codes, or business data codes. For example, you can use AWS Entity Resolution to create a unified view of your customer interactions by linking recent events (such as ad clicks, cart abandonment, and purchases) into a unique entity ID, or better track products that use different codes (like SKUs or UPCs) across your stores.\\nWith AWS Entity Resolution, you can improve matching accuracy and protect data security while minimizing data movement because it reads records where they already live. Let’s see how that works in practice.\\nUsing AWS Entity Resolution As part of my analytics platform, I have a comma-separated values\\xa0(CSV) file containing one million fictitious customers in an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket. These customers come from a loyalty program but can have applied through different channels (online, in store, by post), so it’s possible that multiple records relate to the same customer.\\nThis is the format of the data in the CSV file:\\n\\nloyalty_id, rewards_id, name_id, first_name, middle_initial, last_name, program_id, emp_property_nbr, reward_parent_id, loyalty_program_id, loyalty_program_desc, enrollment_dt, zip_code,country, country_code, address1, address2, address3, address4, city, state_code, state_name, email_address, phone_nbr, phone_type\\n\\nI use an AWS Glue crawler to automatically determine the content of the file and keep the metadata table updated in the data catalog so that it’s available for my analytics jobs. Now, I can use the same setup with AWS Entity Resolution.\\nIn the AWS Entity Resolution console, I choose Get started to see how to set up a matching workflow.\\n\\nTo create a matching workflow, I first need to define my data with a schema mapping.\\n\\nI choose Create schema mapping, enter a name and description, and select the option to import the schema from AWS Glue. I could also define a custom schema using a step-by-step flow or a JSON editor.\\n\\nI select the AWS Glue database and table from the two dropdowns to import columns and pre-populate the input fields.\\n\\nI select the Unique ID from the dropdown. The unique ID is the column that can distinctly reference each row of my data. In this case, it’s the loyalty_id\\xa0in the CSV file.\\n\\nI select the input fields that are going to be used for matching. In this case, I choose the columns from the dropdown that can be used to recognize if multiple records are related to the same customer. If some columns aren’t required for matching but are required in the output file, I can optionally add them as pass-through fields. I choose Next.\\n\\nI map the input fields to their input type and match key. In this way, AWS Entity Resolution knows how to use these fields to match similar records. To continue, I choose Next.\\n\\nNow, I use grouping to better organize the data I need to compare. For example, the First name, Middle name, and Last name input fields can be grouped together and compared as a Full name.\\n\\nI also create a group for the Address fields.\\n\\nI choose Next and review all configurations. Then, I choose Create schema mapping.\\nNow that I’ve created the schema mapping, I choose Matching workflows from the navigation pane and then Create matching workflow.\\n\\nI enter a name and a description. Then, to configure the input data, I select the AWS Glue database and table and the schema mapping.\\n\\nTo give the service access to the data, I select a service role that I configured previously. The service role gives access to the input and output S3 buckets and the AWS Glue database and table. If the input or output buckets are encrypted, the service role can also give access to the AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) keys needed to encrypt and decrypt the data. I choose Next.\\n\\nI have the option to use a rule-based or ML-powered matching method. Depending on the method, I can use a manual or automatic processing cadence to run the matching workflow job. For now, I select Machine learning matching and Manual for the Processing cadence, and then choose Next.\\n\\nI configure an S3 bucket as the output destination. Under Data format, I select Normalized data so that special characters and extra spaces are removed, and data is formatted to lowercase.\\n\\nI use the default Encryption settings. For Data output, I use the default so that all input fields are included. For security, I can hide fields to exclude them from output or hash fields I want to mask. I choose Next.\\nI review all settings and choose Create and run to complete the creation of the matching workflow and run the job for the first time.\\nAfter a few minutes, the job completes. According to this analysis, of the 1 million records, only 835 thousand are unique customers. I choose View output in Amazon S3 to download the output files.\\n\\nIn the output files, each record has the original unique ID (loyalty_id in this case) and a newly assigned MatchID. Matching records, related to the same customers, have the same MatchID. The ConfidenceLevel field describes the confidence that machine learning matching has that the corresponding records are actually a match.\\nI can now use this information to have a better understanding of customers who are subscribed to the loyalty program.\\nAvailability and Pricing AWS Entity Resolution\\xa0is generally available today in the following AWS Regions: US East (Ohio, N. Virginia), US West (Oregon), Asia Pacific (Seoul, Singapore, Sydney, Tokyo), and Europe (Frankfurt, Ireland, London).\\nWith AWS Entity Resolution, you pay only for what you use based on the number of source records processed by your workflows. Pricing doesn’t depend on the matching method, whether it’s machine learning or rule-based record matching. For more information, see AWS Entity Resolution pricing.\\nUsing AWS Entity Resolution, you gain a deeper understanding of how data is linked. That helps you deliver new insights, enhance decision making, and improve customer experiences based on a unified view of their records.\\nSimplify the way you match and link related records across applications, channels, and data stores with AWS Entity Resolution.\\n— Danilo\\n\\nP.S.

AWS customers are increasingly asking us how they can best take advantage of generative AI in their own businesses. Most have accumulated a wealth of domain-specific data (financial records, health records, genomic data, supply chain, and so on), which provides them with a unique and valuable perspective into their business and broader industry. This proprietary data can be an advantage and differentiator for your generative AI strategy.\\nAt the same time, many customers have also noticed the rise in popularity of vector datastores, or vector databases, used in generative AI applications, and are wondering how these solutions fit in their overall data strategy around generative AI applications. In this post, we describe the role of vector databases in generative AI applications, and how AWS solutions can help you harness the power of generative AI.\\nGenerative AI applications\\nAt the heart of every generative AI application is a large language model (LLM). An LLM is a machine learning (ML) model trained on a large body of content—such as all the content accessible on the internet. LLMs trained on vast amounts of publicly accessible data are considered foundational models (FMs). They can be adapted and fine-tuned for a wide range of use cases. Amazon SageMaker JumpStart provides a variety of pre-trained, open-source, and proprietary foundational models for you to build upon, such as Stability AI’s Text2Image model, which can generate photorealistic images using a text prompt, or Hugging Face’s Text2Text Flan T-5 model for text generation. Amazon Bedrock, the easiest way to build and scale generative AI applications with FMs, makes models from AI21 Labs, Anthropic, Stability AI, and Amazon Titan accessible via an API.\\nAlthough a generative AI application relying purely on an FM will have access to broad real-world knowledge, it needs to be customized to produce accurate results on topics that are domain specific or specialized. Also, hallucinations (results that lack accuracy but look correct with confidence) occur more frequently the more specialized the interaction is. So how can you customize your generative AI application for domain specificity?\\nAdding domain specificity using vector datastores\\nPrompt engineering (also referred to as in-context learning) may be the easiest way to ground your generative AI application in your domain-specific context and improve accuracy. Although it won’t completely eliminate hallucinations, this technique will scope down the spectrum of semantic meaning to your own domain.\\nAt its core, the FM infers the next token based on a set of input tokens. A token in this case refers to any element with semantic meaning, like a word or phrase in text generation. The more contextually relevant inputs you provide, the higher the likelihood that the next token inferred is also contextually relevant. The prompt you query the FM with contains the input tokens, plus as much contextually relevant data as possible.\\nThe contextual data typically comes from your internal databases or data lakes, the systems that host your domain-specific data. Although you can enrich the prompt by simply appending additional domain-specific data from these data stores, vector datastores help you engineer your prompts with semantically relevant inputs. This method is called Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). In practice, you will likely engineer a prompt with both contextually personalized data, like user profile information, and semantically similar data.\\nFor generative AI usage, your domain-specific data must be encoded as a set of elements, each expressed internally as a vector. The vector contains a set of numeric values across a set of dimensions (array of numbers). The following figure illustrates an example of transforming context data into semantic elements and then vectors.\\n\\nThese numeric values are used to map elements in relation to each other in a multi-dimensional vector space. When the vector elements are semantic (they represent a form of meaning), the proximity becomes an indicator for contextual relationship. Used in this way, such vectors are referred to as embeddings. For example, the semantic element for “Cheese” may be put in proximity to the semantic element for “Dairy” in a multi-dimensional space representing the data domain context of groceries or cooking. Depending on your specific domain context, a semantic element may be a word, phrase, sentence, paragraph, whole document, image, or something else entirely. You split your domain-specific dataset into meaningful elements that can be related to each other. For example, the following figure illustrates a simplified vector space for a context on cooking.\\n\\nAs a result, to produce the relevant context for the prompt, you need to query a database and find elements that are closely related to your inputs in the vector space. A vector datastore is a system that allows you to store and query vectors at scale, with efficient nearest neighbor query algorithms and appropriate indexes to improve data retrieval. Any database management system that has these vector-related capabilities can be a vector datastore. Many commonly used database systems offer these vector capabilities along with the rest of their functionality. One advantage of storing your domain-specific datasets in a database with vector capabilities is that your vectors will be located close to the source data. You can enrich vector data with additional metadata, without having to query external databases, and you can simplify your data processing pipelines.\\nTo help you get started with vector datastores quickly, today we announced the vector engine for Amazon OpenSearch Serverless, which provides a simple API for storing and querying billions of embeddings, once it becomes generally available. However, we think that in the fullness of time, all AWS databases will have vector capabilities, because that simplifies your operations and data integration. Additionally, the following options are available for more advanced vector datastore needs:\\n\\nAn Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL-Compatible Edition relational database, with the pgvector open-source vector similarity search extension\\nAmazon OpenSearch Service, a distributed search and analytics service, with the k-NN (k-nearest neighbor) plugin, and vector engine for Amazon OpenSearch Serverless\\nAn Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) for PostgreSQL relational database, with the pgvector extension\\n\\nEmbeddings should be stored close to your source data. As a result, where you store your data today, as well as familiarity with these database technologies, scale in terms of vector dimensions, number of embeddings, and performance needs will determine which option is right for you. Before we dive deeper into more specific guidance for these options, let’s first understand how RAG works and how you apply vector datastores in RAG.\\nUsing vector datastores for RAG\\nYou can use embeddings (vectors) to improve the accuracy of your generative AI application. The following diagram illustrates this data flow.\\n\\nYou take your domain-specific dataset (the right side of the preceding figure, depicted in blue), split it into semantic elements, and use the FM to compute the vectors for these semantic elements. Then you store these vectors in a vector datastore, which will enable you to perform similarity search.\\nIn your generative AI application (left side of the preceding figure, depicted in orange), you take the end-user-provided question, split it into semantic elements (tokenization) using the same algorithm that was used on your dataset, and query the vector datastore for the nearest neighbors in the vector space for the input elements. The store will provide you with contextually similar semantic elements that you then add to your engineered prompt. This process will further ground the LLM into your domain-specific context, increasing the likelihood that the LLM output is accurate and relevant to that context.\\nPerforming similarity searches in your vector datastore, in the critical path of end-users, uses concurrent read queries. Batch processes to populate the vector datastore with embeddings and keep up with data changes are mostly data writes to the vector datastore. Aspects of this usage pattern along with previously mentioned considerations, like familiarity and scale, determine which service—Aurora PostgreSQL-Compatible, OpenSearch Service, the vector engine for OpenSearch Serverless, or Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL—is right for you.\\nVector datastore considerations\\nThe usage pattern we described also leads to some unique and important considerations for vector datastores.\\nThe volume of domain-specific data you wish to use and the process you use to split up that data into semantic elements will determine the number of embeddings your vector datastore needs to support. As your domain-specific data grows and changes over time, your vector datastore also has to accommodate that growth. This has impact on indexing efficiency and performance at scale. It’s not uncommon for domain-specific datasets to result in hundreds of millions—even billions—of embeddings. You use a tokenizer to split the data, and the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) provides several general purpose tokenizers you can use. But you can use alternatives, too. Ultimately, the right tokenizer depends on what a semantic element in your domain-specific dataset is—as previously mentioned, it could be a word, phrase, paragraph of text, entire document, or any subdivision of your data that holds independent meaning.\\nThe number of dimensions for the embedding vectors is another important factor to consider. Different FMs produce vectors with different numbers of dimensions. For example, the all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model produces vectors with 384 dimensions, and Falcon-40B vectors have 8,192 dimensions. The more dimensions a vector has, the richer the context it can represent—up to a point. You will eventually see diminishing returns and increased query latency. This eventually leads to the curse of dimensionality (objects appear sparse and dissimilar). To perform semantic similarity searches, you generally need vectors with dense dimensionality, but you may need to reduce the dimensions of your embeddings for your database to handle such searches efficiently.\\nAnother consideration is whether you need exact similarity search results. Indexing capabilities in vector datastores will speed up similarity search considerably, but they will also use an approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) algorithm to produce results. ANN algorithms provide performance and memory efficiencies in exchange for accuracy. They can’t guarantee that they return the exact nearest neighbors every time.\\nFinally, consider data governance. Your domain-specific datasets likely contain highly sensitive data, such as personal data or intellectual property. With your vector datastore close to your existing domain-specific datasets, you can extend your access, quality, and security controls to your vector datastore, simplifying operations. In many cases, it won’t be feasible to strip away such sensitive data without affecting the semantic meaning of the data, which in turn reduces accuracy. Therefore, it’s important to understand and control the flow of your data through the systems that create, store, and query embeddings.\\nUsing Aurora PostgreSQL or Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL with pgvector\\nPgvector, an open-source, community-supported PostgreSQL extension, is available both in Aurora PostgreSQL and Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL. The extension expands PostgreSQL with a vector data type called vector, three query operators for similarity searching (Euclidian, negative inner product, and cosine distance), and the ivfflat (inverted file with stored vectors) indexing mechanism for vectors to perform faster approximate distance searches. Although you can store vectors with up to 16,000 dimensions, only 2,000 dimensions can be indexed to improve similarity search performance. In practice, customers tend to use embeddings with fewer dimensions. The post Building AI-powered search in PostgreSQL using Amazon SageMaker and pgvector is a great resource to dive deeper into this extension.\\nYou should strongly consider using Aurora PostgreSQL with the pgvector extension for your vector datastore if you are already heavily invested in relational databases, especially PostgreSQL, and have a lot of expertise in that space. Also, highly structured domain-specific datasets are a more natural fit for relational databases. Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL can also be a great choice if you need to use specific community versions of PostgreSQL. Similarity search queries (reads) can also scale horizontally subject to the maximum number of read replicas supported by Aurora in a single DB cluster (15) and Amazon RDS in a replication chain (15).\\nAurora PostgreSQL also supports Amazon Aurora Serverless v2, an on-demand, auto scaling configuration that can adjust the compute and memory capacity of your DB instances automatically based on load. This configuration simplifies operations because you no longer have to provision for peak or perform complex capacity planning in most use cases.\\nAmazon Aurora Machine Learning (Aurora ML) is a feature you can use to make calls to ML models hosted in Amazon SageMaker via SQL functions. You can use it to make calls to your FMs to generate embeddings directly from your database. You can package these calls into stored procedures or integrate them with other PostgreSQL capabilities, such that the vectorization process is completely abstracted away from the application. With the batching capabilities built into Aurora ML, you may not even need to export the initial dataset from Aurora in order to transform it to create the initial set of vectors.\\nUsing OpenSearch Service with the k-NN plugin and the vector engine for OpenSearch Serverless\\nThe k-NN plugin expands OpenSearch, an open-source, distributed search and analytics suite, with the custom knn_vector data type, enabling you to store embeddings in OpenSearch indexes. The plugin also provides three methods to perform k-nearest neighbor similarity searches: Approximate k-NN, Script Score k-NN (exact), and the Painless extensions (exact). OpenSearch includes the Non-Metric Space Library (NMSLIB) and Facebook AI Research’s FAISS library. You can use different search algorithms for distance to find the best one that meets your needs. This plugin is also available in OpenSearch Service, and the post Amazon OpenSearch Service’s vector database capabilities explained is a great resource to dive deeper into these features.\\nDue to the distributed nature of OpenSearch, it’s a great choice for vector datastores with a very large number of embeddings. Your indexes scale horizontally, allowing you to handle more throughput for storing embeddings and performing similarity searches. It’s also a great choice for customers who want to have deeper control over the method and algorithms used to perform searches. Search engines are designed for low-latency, high throughput querying, trading off transactional behavior to achieve that.\\nOpenSearch Serverless is an on-demand serverless configuration that removes the operational complexities of provisioning, configuring, and tuning OpenSearch domains. You simply start by creating a collection of indexes and start populating your index data. The newly announced vector engine for OpenSearch Serverless is offered as a new vector collection type, along with search and time series collections. It gives you an easy way to get started working with vector similarity search. It provides an easy-to-operate pairing for Amazon Bedrock to integrate prompt engineering into your generative AI applications, without needing advanced expertise in ML or vector technology. With the vector engine, you’re able to query vector embeddings, metadata, and descriptive text easily within a single API call, resulting in more accurate search results while reducing complexity in your application stack.\\nVectors in OpenSearch with the k-NN plugin support up to 16,000 dimensions when using the nmslib and faiss engines, and 1,024 dimensions with the Lucene engine. Lucene provides the core search and analytics capabilities of OpenSearch, along with vector search. OpenSearch uses a custom REST API for most operations, including similarity searches. It enables greater flexibility when interacting with OpenSearch indexes, while allowing you to reuse skills for building distributed web-based applications.\\nOpenSearch is also a great option if you need to combine semantic similarity search with keyword search use cases. Prompt engineering for generative AI applications involves both retrieval of contextual data and RAG. For example, a customer support agent application may build a prompt by including previous support cases with the same keywords, as well as support cases that are semantically similar, so the recommended solution is grounded in the appropriate context.\\nThe Neural Search plugin (experimental) enables the integration of ML language models directly into your OpenSearch workflows. With this plugin, OpenSearch automatically creates vectors for the text provided during ingestion and search. It then seamlessly uses the vectors for search queries. This can simplify similarity search tasks used in RAG.\\nAdditionally, if you prefer a fully managed semantic search experience on domain-specific data, you should consider Amazon Kendra. It provides out-of-the-box semantic search capabilities for state-of-the-art ranking of documents and passages, eliminating the overhead of managing text extraction, passage splitting, getting embeddings, and managing vector datastores. You can use Amazon Kendra for your semantic search needs and package the results into your engineered prompt, thereby maximizing the benefits of RAG with the least amount of operational overhead. The post Quickly build high-accuracy Generative AI applications on enterprise data using Amazon Kendra, LangChain, and large language models provides deeper guidance for this use case.\\nFinally, Aurora PostgreSQL and Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL with pgvector, the vector engine for OpenSearch Serverless, and OpenSearch Service with k-NN are supported in LangChain. LangChain is a popular Python framework for developing data-aware, agent-style applications based on LLMs.\\nSummary\\nEmbeddings should be stored and managed close to your domain-specific datasets. Doing so allows you to combine them with additional metadata without using additional, external data sources. Your data is also not static, but changes over time, and storing the embeddings near your source data simplifies your data pipelines for keeping the embeddings up to date.\\nAurora PostgreSQL and Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL with pgvector, as well as the vector engine for OpenSearch Serverless and OpenSearch Service with the k-NN plugin, are great choices for your vector datastore needs, but which solution is right for you will ultimately depend on your use case and priorities. If your database of choice doesn’t have vector capabilities, the options discussed in this post span the spectrum of familiarity with SQL and NoSQL and are straightforward to pick up without a lot of operational overhead. No matter which option you choose, your vector datastore solution needs to sustain the concurrent throughput dispatched by the application. Validate your solution at scale with a full set of embeddings, so the similarity search response latencies meet your expectations.\\nAt the same time, prompt engineering used in conjunction with foundational models provided by SageMaker JumpStart and Amazon Bedrock will enable you to build innovative generative AI solutions to delight your customers, without having to invest in significant ML skills.\\nOn a final note, keep in mind technology is evolving rapidly in this space, and although we will make every effort to update our guidance as things change, the recommendations in this post may not be universally applicable.\\nGet started building generative AI applications on AWS today!

The vector engine provides a simple, scalable, and high-performing similarity search capability in Amazon OpenSearch Serverless that makes it easy for you to build modern machine learning (ML) augmented search experiences and generative artificial intelligence (AI) applications without having to manage the underlying vector database infrastructure. This post summarizes the features and functionalities of our vector engine.\\nUsing augmented ML search and generative AI with vector embeddings\\nOrganizations across all verticals are rapidly adopting generative AI for its ability to handle vast datasets, generate automated content, and provide interactive, human-like responses. Customers are exploring ways to transform the end-user experience and interaction with their digital platform by integrating advanced conversational generative AI applications such as chatbots, question and answer systems, and personalized recommendations. These conversational applications enable you to search and query in natural language and generate responses that closely resemble human-like responses by accounting for the semantic meaning, user intent, and query context.\\nML-augmented search applications and generative AI applications use vector embeddings, which are numerical representations of text, image, audio, and video data to generate dynamic and relevant content. The vector embeddings are trained on your private data and represent the semantic and contextual attributes of the information. Ideally, these embeddings can be stored and managed close to your domain-specific datasets, such as within your existing search engine or database. This enables you to process a user’s query to find the closest vectors and combine them with additional metadata without relying on external data sources or additional application code to integrate the results. Customers want a vector database option that is simple to build on and enables them to move quickly from prototyping to production so they can focus on creating differentiated applications. The vector engine for OpenSearch Serverless extends OpenSearch’s search capabilities by enabling you to store, search, and retrieve billions of vector embeddings in real time and perform accurate similarity matching and semantic searches without having to think about the underlying infrastructure.\\nExploring the vector engine’s capabilities\\nBuilt on OpenSearch Serverless, the vector engine inherits and benefits from its robust architecture. With the vector engine, you don’t have to worry about sizing, tuning, and scaling the backend infrastructure. The vector engine automatically adjusts resources by adapting to changing workload patterns and demand to provide consistently fast performance and scale. As the number of vectors grows from a few thousand during prototyping to hundreds of millions and beyond in production, the vector engine will scale seamlessly, without the need for reindexing or reloading your data to scale your infrastructure. Additionally, the vector engine has separate compute for indexing and search workloads, so you can seamlessly ingest, update, and delete vectors in real time while ensuring that the query performance your users experience remains unaffected. All the data is persisted in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), so you get the same data durability guarantees as Amazon S3 (eleven nines). Even though we are still in preview, the vector engine is designed for production workloads with redundancy for Availability Zone outages and infrastructure failures.\\nThe vector engine for OpenSearch Serverless is powered by the k-nearest neighbor (kNN) search feature in the open-source OpenSearch Project, proven to deliver reliable and precise results. Many customers today are using OpenSearch kNN search in managed clusters for offering semantic search and personalization in their applications. With the vector engine, you can get the same functionality with the simplicity of a serverless environment. The vector engine supports the popular distance metrics such as Euclidean, cosine similarity, and dot product, and can accommodate 16,000 dimensions, making it well-suited to support a wide range of foundational and other AI/ML models. You can also store diverse fields with various data types such as numeric, boolean, date, keyword, geopoint for metadata, and text for descriptive information to add more context to the stored vectors. Colocating the data types reduces the complexity and maintainability and avoids data duplication, version compatibility challenges, and licensing issues, effectively simplifying your application stack. Because the vector engine supports the same OpenSearch open-source suite APIs, you can take advantage of its rich query capabilities, such as full text search, advanced filtering, aggregations, geo-spatial query, nested queries for faster retrieval of data, and enhanced search results. For example, if your use case requires you to find the results within 15 miles of the requestor, the vector engine can do this in a single query, eliminating the need for maintaining two different systems and then combining the results through application logic. With support for integration with LangChain, Amazon Bedrock, and Amazon SageMaker, you can easily integrate your preferred ML and AI system with the vector engine.\\nThe vector engine supports a wide range of use cases across various domains, including image search, document search, music retrieval, product recommendation, video search, location-based search, fraud detection, and anomaly detection. We also anticipate a growing trend for hybrid searches that combine lexical search methods with advanced ML and generative AI capabilities. For example, when a user searches for a “red shirt” on your e-commerce website, semantic search helps expand the scope by retrieving all shades of red, while preserving the tuning and boosting logic implemented on the lexical (BM25) search. With OpenSearch filtering, you can further enhance the relevance of your search results by providing users with options to refine their search based on size, brand, price range, and availability in nearby stores, allowing for a more personalized and precise experience. The hybrid search support in the vector engine enables you to query vector embeddings, metadata, and descriptive information within a single query call, making it easy to provide more accurate and contextually relevant search results without building complex application code.\\nYou can get started in minutes with the vector engine by creating a specialized vector search collection under OpenSearch Serverless using the AWS Management Console, AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), or the AWS software development kit (AWS SDK). Collections are a logical grouping of indexed data that works together to support a workload, while the physical resources are automatically managed in the backend. You don’t have to declare how much compute or storage is needed or monitor the system to make sure it’s running well. OpenSearch Serverless applies different sharding and indexing strategies for the three available collection types: time series, search, and vector search. The vector engine’s compute capacity used for data ingestion, and search and query are measured in OpenSearch Compute Units (OCUs). One OCU can handle 4 million vectors for 128 dimensions or 500K for 768 dimensions at 99% recall rate.\\xa0The vector engine is built on OpenSearch Serverless, which is a highly available service and requires a minimum of 4 OCUs (two OCUs for the ingest including primary and standby, and two OCUs for the search with two active replicas across Availability Zones) for that first collection in an account. All subsequent collections using the same AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) key can share those OCUs.\\nGet started with vector embeddings\\nTo get started using vector embeddings using the console, complete the following steps:\\n\\nCreate a new collection on the OpenSearch Serverless console.\\nProvide a name and optional description.\\nCurrently, vector embeddings are supported exclusively by vector search collections; therefore, for Collection type, select Vector search.\\nNext, you must configure the security policies, which includes encryption, network, and data access policies.\\n\\nWe are introducing the new Easy create option, which streamlines the security configuration for faster onboarding. All the data in the vector engine is encrypted in transit and at rest by default. You can choose to bring your own encryption key or use the one provided by the service that is dedicated for your collection or account. You can choose to host your collection on a public endpoint or within a VPC. The vector engine supports fine-grained AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) permissions so that you can define who can create, update, and delete encryption, network, collections, and indexes, thereby enabling organizational alignment.\\n\\n\\nWith the security settings in place, you can finish creating the collection.\\n\\nAfter the collection is successfully created, you can create the vector index. At this point, you can use the API or the console to create an index. An index is a collection of documents with a common data schema and provides a way for you to store, search, and retrieve your vector embeddings and other fields. The vector index supports up to 1,000 fields.\\n\\nTo create the vector index, you must define the vector field name, dimensions, and the distance metric.\\n\\nThe vector index supports up to 16,000 dimensions and three types of distance metrics: Euclidean, cosine, and dot product.\\n\\nOnce you have successfully created the index, you can use OpenSearch’s powerful query capabilities to get comprehensive search results.\\nThe following example shows how easily you can create a simple property listing index with the title, description, price, and location details as fields using the OpenSearch API. By using the query APIs, this index can efficiently provide accurate results to match your search requests, such as “Find me a two-bedroom apartment in Seattle that is under $3000.”\\n\\nFrom preview to GA and beyond\\nToday, we are excited to announce the preview of the vector engine, making it available for you to begin testing it out immediately. As we noted earlier, OpenSearch Serverless was designed to provide a highly available service to power your enterprise applications, with independent compute resources for index and search and built-in redundancy.\\nWe recognize that many of you are in the experimentation phase and would like a more economical option for dev-test. Prior to GA, we plan to offer two features that will enable us to reduce the cost of your first collection. The first is a new dev-test option that enables you to launch a collection with no active standby or replica, reducing the entry cost by 50%. The vector engine still provides durability guarantees because it persists all the data in Amazon S3. The second is to initially provision a 0.5 OCU footprint, which will scale up as needed to support your workload, further lowering costs if your initial workload is in the tens of thousands to low-hundreds of thousands of vectors (depending on the number of dimensions). Between these two features, we will reduce the minimum OCUs needed to power your first collection from 4 OCUs down to 1 OCU per hour.\\nWe are also working on features that will allow us to achieve workload pause and resume capabilities in the coming months, which is particularly useful for the vector engine because many of these use cases don’t require continuous indexing of the data.\\nLastly, we are diligently focused on optimizing the performance and memory usage of the vector graphs, including improving caching, merging and more.\\nWhile we work on these cost reductions, we will be offering the first 1400 OCU-hours per month free on vector collections until the dev-test option is made available. This will enable you to test the vector engine preview for up to two weeks every month at no cost, based on your workload.\\nSummary\\nThe vector engine for OpenSearch Serverless introduces a simple, scalable, and high-performing vector storage and search capability that makes it straightforward for you to quickly store and query billions of vector embeddings generated from a variety of ML models, such as those provided by Amazon Bedrock, with response times in milliseconds.\\nThe preview release of vector engine for OpenSearch Serverless is now available in eight Regions globally: US East (Ohio), US East (N. Virginia), US West (Oregon), Asia Pacific (Singapore), Asia Pacific (Sydney), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Europe (Frankfurt), and Europe (Ireland).\\nWe are the excited about the future ahead and your feedback will play a vital role in guiding the progress of this product. We encourage you to try out the vector engine for OpenSearch Serverless and share your use cases, questions, and feedback in the comments section.\\nIn the coming weeks, we will be publishing a series of posts to provide you with detailed guidance on how to integrate the vector engine with LangChain, Amazon Bedrock, and SageMaker.

Integrating data from different sources can be a complex and time-consuming process. AWS offers AWS Glue to help you integrate your data from multiple sources on serverless infrastructure for analysis, machine learning (ML), and application development. AWS Glue provides different authoring experiences for you to build data integration jobs. One of the most common options is the notebook. Data scientists tend to run queries interactively and retrieve results immediately to author data integration jobs. This interactive experience can accelerate building data integration pipelines.\\nRecently, AWS announced general availability of Amazon CodeWhisperer. Amazon CodeWhisperer is an AI coding companion that uses foundational models under the hood to improve developer productivity. This works by generating code suggestions in real time based on developers’ comments in natural language and prior code in their integrated development environment (IDE). AWS also announced the Amazon CodeWhisperer Jupyter extension to help Jupyter users by generating real-time, single-line, or full-function code suggestions for Python notebooks on Jupyter Lab and Amazon SageMaker Studio.\\nToday, we are excited to announce that AWS Glue Studio notebooks now support Amazon CodeWhisperer for AWS Glue users to improve your experience and help boost development productivity. Now, in your Glue Studio notebook, you can write a comment in natural language (in English) that outlines a specific task, such as “Create a Spark DataFrame from a json file.”. Based on this information, CodeWhisperer recommends one or more code snippets directly in the notebook that can accomplish the task. You can quickly accept the top suggestion, view more suggestions, or continue writing your own code.\\n\\nThis post demonstrates how the user experience on AWS Glue Studio notebook has been changed with the Amazon CodeWhisperer integration.\\nPrerequisites\\nBefore going forward with this tutorial, you need to complete the following prerequisites:\\n\\nSet up AWS Glue Studio.\\nConfigure an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role to interact with Amazon CodeWhisperer. Attach the following policy to your IAM role for the AWS Glue Studio notebook: \\n         \\n{\\n    \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\\n    \"Statement\": [\\n        {\\n            \"Sid\": \"CodeWhispererPermissions\",\\n            \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\\n            \"Action\": [\\n                \"codewhisperer:GenerateRecommendations\"\\n            ],\\n            \"Resource\": \"*\"\\n        }\\n    ]\\n}\\n \\n\\nGetting Started\\nLet’s get started. Create a new AWS Glue Studio notebook job by completing the following steps:\\n\\nOn the AWS Glue console, choose Notebooks under ETL jobs in the navigation pane.\\nSelect Jupyter Notebook and choose Create.\\nFor Job name, enter codewhisperer-demo.\\nFor IAM Role, select your IAM role that you configured as a prerequisite.\\nChoose Start notebook.\\n\\nA new notebook is created with sample cells.\\n\\nAt the bottom, there is a menu named CodeWhisperer. By choosing this menu, you can see the shortcuts and several options, including disabling auto-suggestions.\\n\\nLet’s try your first recommendation by Amazon CodeWhisperer. Note that this post contains examples of recommendations, but you may see different code snippets recommended by Amazon CodeWhisperer.\\nAdd a new cell and enter your comment to describe what you want to achieve.

This announcement is the product of more than a decade of collaboration between AWS and NVIDIA, delivering the visual computing, AI, and high performance computing (HPC) clusters across the Cluster GPU (cg1) instances (2010), G2 (2013), P2 (2016), P3 (2017), G3 (2017), P3dn (2018), G4 (2019), P4 (2020), G5 (2021), and P4de instances (2022).\\nMost notably, ML model sizes are now reaching trillions of parameters. But this complexity has increased customers’ time to train, where the latest LLMs are now trained over the course of multiple months. HPC customers also exhibit similar trends. With the fidelity of HPC customer data collection increasing and data sets reaching exabyte scale, customers are looking for ways to enable faster time to solution across increasingly complex applications.\\nIntroducing EC2 P5 Instances Today, we are announcing the general availability of Amazon EC2 P5 instances, the next-generation GPU instances to address those customer needs for high performance and scalability in AI/ML and HPC workloads. P5 instances are powered by the latest NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs and will provide a reduction of up to 6 times in training time (from days to hours) compared to previous generation GPU-based instances. This performance increase will enable customers to see up to 40 percent lower training costs.\\nP5 instances provide 8 x NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs with 640 GB of high bandwidth GPU memory, 3rd Gen AMD EPYC processors, 2 TB of system memory, and 30 TB of local NVMe storage. P5 instances also provide 3200 Gbps of aggregate network bandwidth with support for GPUDirect RDMA, enabling lower latency and efficient scale-out performance by bypassing the CPU on internode communication.\\nHere is the specs for this instance:\\n\\n\\n\\nInstance Size\\nvCPUs\\nMemory (GiB)\\nGPUs (H100)\\nNetwork Bandwidth (Gbps)\\nEBS Bandwidth (Gbps)\\nLocal Storage (TB)\\n\\n\\np5.48xlarge\\n192\\n2048\\n8\\n3200\\n80\\n8 x 3.84\\n\\n\\n\\nHere’s a quick infographic that shows you how the P5 instances and NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs compare to previous instances and processors:\\n\\nP5 instances are ideal for training and running inference for increasingly complex LLMs and computer vision models behind the most demanding and compute-intensive generative AI applications, including question answering, code generation, video and image generation, speech recognition, and more. P5 will provide up to 6 times lower time to train compared with previous generation GPU-based instances across those applications. Customers who can use lower precision FP8 data types in their workloads, common in many language models that use a transformer model backbone, will see further benefit at up to 6 times performance increase through support for the NVIDIA Transformer Engine.\\nHPC customers using P5 instances can deploy demanding applications at greater scale in pharmaceutical discovery, seismic analysis, weather forecasting, and financial modeling. Customers using dynamic programming (DP) algorithms for applications like genome sequencing or accelerated data analytics will also see further benefit from P5 through support for a new DPX instruction set.\\nThis enables customers to explore problem spaces that previously seemed unreachable, iterate on their solutions at a faster clip, and get to market more quickly.\\nYou can see the detail of instance specifications along with comparisons of instance types between p4d.24xlarge and new p5.48xlarge below:\\n\\n\\n\\nFeature\\np4d.24xlarge\\np5.48xlarge\\nComparison\\n\\n\\nNumber & Type of Accelerators\\n8 x NVIDIA A100\\n8 x NVIDIA H100\\n–\\n\\n\\nFP8 TFLOPS per Server\\n–\\n16,000\\n6.4x vs.A100 FP16\\n\\n\\nFP16 TFLOPS per Server\\n2,496\\n8,000\\n\\n\\nGPU Memory\\n40 GB\\n80 GB\\n2x\\n\\n\\nGPU Memory Bandwidth\\n12.8 TB/s\\n26.8 TB/s\\n2x\\n\\n\\nCPU Family\\nIntel Cascade Lake\\nAMD Milan\\n–\\n\\n\\nvCPUs\\n96\\n\\xa0192\\n2x\\n\\n\\nTotal System Memory\\n1152 GB\\n2048 GB\\n2x\\n\\n\\nNetworking Throughput\\n400 Gbps\\n3200 Gbps\\n8x\\n\\n\\nEBS Throughput\\n19 Gbps\\n80 Gbps\\n4x\\n\\n\\nLocal Instance Storage\\n8 TBs NVMe\\n30 TBs NVMe\\n3.75x\\n\\n\\nGPU to GPU Interconnect\\n600 GB/s\\n900 GB/s\\n1.5x\\n\\n\\n\\nSecond-generation Amazon EC2 UltraClusters and Elastic Fabric Adaptor P5 instances provide market-leading scale-out capability for multi-node distributed training and tightly coupled HPC workloads. They offer up to 3,200 Gbps of networking using the second-generation Elastic Fabric Adaptor (EFA) technology, 8 times compared with P4d instances.\\nTo address customer needs for large-scale and low latency, P5 instances are deployed in the second-generation EC2 UltraClusters, which now provide customers with lower latency across up to 20,000+ NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs. Providing the largest scale of ML infrastructure in the cloud, P5 instances in EC2 UltraClusters deliver up to 20 exaflops of aggregate compute capability.\\n\\nEC2 UltraClusters use Amazon FSx for Lustre, fully managed shared storage built on the most popular high-performance parallel file system. With FSx for Lustre, you can quickly process massive datasets on demand and at scale and deliver sub-millisecond latencies. The low-latency and high-throughput characteristics of FSx for Lustre are optimized for deep learning, generative AI, and HPC workloads on EC2 UltraClusters.\\nFSx for Lustre keeps the GPUs and ML accelerators in EC2 UltraClusters fed with data, accelerating the most demanding workloads. These workloads include LLM training, generative AI inferencing, and HPC workloads, such as genomics and financial risk modeling.\\nGetting Started with EC2 P5 Instances To get started, you can use P5 instances in the US East (N. Virginia) and US West (Oregon) Region.\\n\\nWhen launching P5 instances, you will choose AWS Deep Learning AMIs (DLAMIs) to support P5 instances. DLAMI provides ML practitioners and researchers with the infrastructure and tools to quickly build scalable, secure distributed ML applications in preconfigured environments.\\nYou will be able to run containerized applications on P5 instances with AWS Deep Learning Containers using libraries for Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) or Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service \\xa0(Amazon EKS). \\xa0For a more managed experience, you can also use P5 instances via Amazon SageMaker, which helps developers and data scientists easily scale to tens, hundreds, or thousands of GPUs to train a model quickly at any scale without worrying about setting up clusters and data pipelines. HPC customers can leverage AWS Batch and ParallelCluster with P5 to help orchestrate jobs and clusters efficiently.\\nExisting P4 customers will need to update their AMIs to use P5 instances. Specifically, you will need to update your AMIs to include the latest NVIDIA driver with support for NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs. They will also need to install the latest CUDA version (CUDA 12), CuDNN version, framework versions (e.g., PyTorch, Tensorflow), and EFA driver with updated topology files. To make this process easy for you, we will provide new DLAMIs and Deep Learning Containers that come prepackaged with all the needed software and frameworks to use P5 instances out of the box.\\nNow Available Amazon EC2 P5 instances are available today in AWS Regions: US East (N. Virginia) and US West (Oregon). For more information, see the Amazon EC2 pricing page. To learn more, see EC2 P5 instance page and send feedback to AWS re:Post for EC2 or through your usual AWS Support contacts.\\nYou can choose a broad range of AWS services that have generative AI built in, all running on the most cost-effective cloud infrastructure for generative AI.

Amazon Bedrock, currently available in preview, is a fully managed service that makes foundation models (FMs) from Amazon and leading AI startups—such as AI21 Labs, Anthropic, Cohere, and Stability AI—available through an API.\\nToday, I’m excited to announce the preview of agents for Amazon Bedrock, a new capability for developers to create fully managed agents in a few clicks. Agents for Amazon Bedrock accelerate the delivery of generative AI applications that can manage and perform tasks by making API calls to your company systems. Agents extend FMs to understand user requests, break down complex tasks into multiple steps, carry on a conversation to collect additional information, and take actions to fulfill the request.\\n\\nUsing agents for Amazon Bedrock, you can automate tasks for your internal or external customers, such as managing retail orders or processing insurance claims. For example, an agent-powered generative AI e-commerce application can not only respond to the question, “Do you have this jacket in blue?” with a simple answer but can also help you with the task of updating your order or managing an exchange.\\nFor this to work, you first need to give the agent access to external data sources and connect it to existing APIs of other applications. This allows the FM that powers the agent to interact with the broader world and extend its utility beyond just language processing tasks. Second, the FM needs to figure out what actions to take, what information to use, and in which sequence to perform these actions. This is possible thanks to an exciting emerging behavior of FMs—their ability to reason. You can show FMs how to handle such interactions and how to reason through tasks by building prompts that include definitions and instructions. The process of designing prompts to guide the model towards desired outputs is known as prompt engineering.\\nIntroducing Agents for Amazon Bedrock Agents for Amazon Bedrock automate the prompt engineering and orchestration of user-requested tasks. Once configured, an agent automatically builds the prompt and securely augments it with your company-specific information to provide responses back to the user in natural language. The agent is able to figure out the actions required to automatically process user-requested tasks. It breaks the task into multiple steps, orchestrates a sequence of API calls and data lookups, and maintains memory to complete the action for the user.\\nWith fully managed agents, you don’t have to worry about provisioning or managing infrastructure. You’ll have seamless support for monitoring, encryption, user permissions, and API invocation management without writing custom code. As a developer, you can use the Bedrock console or SDK to upload the API schema. The agent then orchestrates the tasks with the help of FMs and performs API calls using AWS Lambda functions.\\nPrimer on Advanced Reasoning and ReAct You can help FMs to reason and figure out how to solve user-requested tasks with a reasoning technique called ReAct (synergizing reasoning and acting). Using ReAct, you can structure prompts to show an FM how to reason through a task and decide on actions that help find a solution.\\xa0The structured prompts include a sequence of question-thought-action-observation examples.\\nThe question is the user-requested task or problem to solve. The thought is a reasoning step that helps demonstrate to the FM how to tackle the problem and identify an action to take. The action is an API that the model can invoke from an allowed set of APIs. The observation is the result of carrying out the action. The actions that the FM is able to choose from are defined by a set of instructions that are prepended to the example prompt text. Here is an illustration of how you would build up a ReAct prompt:\\n\\nThe good news is that Bedrock performs the heavy lifting for you! Behind the scenes, agents for Amazon Bedrock build the prompts based on the information and actions you provide.\\nNow, let me show you how to get started with agents for Amazon Bedrock.\\nCreate an Agent for Amazon Bedrock Let’s assume you’re a developer at an insurance company and want to provide a generative AI application that helps the insurance agency owners automate repetitive tasks. You create an agent in Bedrock and integrate it into your application.\\nTo get started with the agent, open the Bedrock console, select\\xa0Agents in the left navigation panel, then choose Create Agent.\\n\\nThis starts the agent creation workflow.\\n\\nProvide agent details including agent name, description (optional), whether the agent is allowed to request additional user inputs, and the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) service role that gives your agent access to other required services, such as Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) and AWS Lambda.\\nSelect a foundation model from Bedrock that fits your use case. Here, you provide an instruction to your agent in natural language. The instruction tells the agent what task it’s supposed to perform and the persona it’s supposed to assume. For example, “You are an agent designed to help with processing insurance claims and managing pending paperwork.”\\nAdd action groups. An action is a task that the agent can perform automatically by making API calls to your company systems. A set of actions is defined in an action group. Here, you provide an API schema that defines the APIs for all the actions in the group. You also must provide a Lambda function that represents the business logic for each API. For example, let’s define an action group called ClaimManagementActionGroup that manages insurance claims by pulling a list of open claims, identifying outstanding paperwork for each claim, and sending reminders to policy holders. Make sure to capture this information in the action group description. The business logic for my action group is captured in the Lambda function InsuranceClaimsLambda. This AWS Lambda function implements methods for the following API calls: open-claims, identify-missing-documents, and send-reminders.Here’s a short extract from my InsuranceClaimsLambda function: import json\\nimport time\\n \\ndef open_claims():\\n...\\n\\ndef identify_missing_documents(parameters):\\n...\\n \\ndef send_reminders():\\n...\\n \\ndef lambda_handler(event, context):\\nresponses = []\\n \\nfor prediction in event[\\'actionGroups\\']:\\nresponse_code = ...\\naction = prediction[\\'actionGroup\\']\\napi_path = prediction[\\'apiPath\\']\\n\\nif api_path == \\'/claims\\':\\nbody = open_claims() \\nelif api_path == \\'/claims/{claimId}/identify-missing-documents\\':\\n\\t\\t\\tparameters = prediction[\\'parameters\\']\\nbody = identify_missing_documents(parameters)\\nelif api_path == \\'/send-reminders\\':\\nbody =send_reminders()\\nelse:\\nbody = {\"{}::{} is not a valid api, try another one.\".format(action, api_path)}\\n \\nresponse_body = {\\n\\'application/json\\': {\\n\\'body\\': str(body)\\n}\\n}\\n\\naction_response = {\\n\\'actionGroup\\': prediction[\\'actionGroup\\'],\\n\\'apiPath\\': prediction[\\'apiPath\\'],\\n\\'httpMethod\\': prediction[\\'httpMethod\\'],\\n\\'httpStatusCode\\': response_code,\\n\\'responseBody\\': response_body\\n}\\n\\nresponses.append(action_response)\\n \\napi_response = {\\'response\\': responses}\\n \\nreturn api_response Note that you also must provide an API schema in the OpenAPI schema JSON format. Here’s what my API schema file insurance_claim_schema.json looks like: {\"openapi\": \"3.0.0\",\\n\"info\": {\\n\"title\": \"Insurance Claims Automation API\",\\n\"version\": \"1.0.0\",\\n\"description\": \"APIs for managing insurance claims by pulling a list of open claims, identifying outstanding paperwork for each claim, and sending reminders to policy holders.\"\\n},\\n\"paths\": {\\n\"/claims\": {\\n\"get\": {\\n\"summary\": \"Get a list of all open claims\",\\n\"description\": \"Get the list of all open insurance claims.

Bedrock then automatically creates a version for that alias.\\n\\nIn the Bedrock console, select your agent, then select Deploy, and choose Create to create an alias.\\nProvide an alias name and description and choose whether to create a new version or use an existing version of your agent to associate with this alias. \\nThis saves a snapshot of the agent code and configuration and associates an alias with this snapshot or version. You can use the alias to integrate the agent into your applications. \\n\\nNow, let’s test the insurance agent! You can do this right in the Bedrock console.\\nLet’s ask the agent to “Send reminder to all policy holders with open claims and pending paper work.” You can see how the FM-powered agent is able to understand the user request, break down the task into steps (collect the open insurance claims, lookup the claim IDs, send reminders), and perform the corresponding actions.\\n\\nAgents for Amazon Bedrock can help you increase productivity, improve your customer service experience, or automate DevOps tasks.

Because information can be gathered in different ways, there is also the issue of different but equivalent data, such as for street addresses (“5th Avenue” and “5th Ave”). As a consequence, it’s not easy to link related records together to create a unified view and gain better insights.\\nFor example, companies want to run advertising campaigns to reach consumers across multiple applications and channels with personalized messaging. Companies often have to deal with disparate data records that contain incomplete or conflicting information, creating a difficult matching process.\\nIn the retail industry, companies have to reconcile, across their supply chain and stores, products that use multiple and different product codes, such as stock keeping units (SKUs), universal product codes (UPCs), or proprietary codes. This prevents them from analyzing information quickly and holistically.\\nOne way to address this problem is to build bespoke data resolution solutions such as complex SQL queries interacting with multiple databases, or train machine learning (ML) models for record matching. But these solutions take months to build, require development resources, and are costly to maintain.\\nTo help you with that, today we’re introducing AWS Entity Resolution, an ML-powered service that helps you match and link related records stored across multiple applications, channels, and data stores. You can get started in minutes configuring entity resolution workflows that are flexible, scalable, and can seamlessly connect to your existing applications.\\nAWS Entity Resolution offers advanced matching techniques, such as rule-based matching and machine learning models, to help you accurately link related sets of customer information, product codes, or business data codes. For example, you can use AWS Entity Resolution to create a unified view of your customer interactions by linking recent events (such as ad clicks, cart abandonment, and purchases) into a unique entity ID, or better track products that use different codes (like SKUs or UPCs) across your stores.\\nWith AWS Entity Resolution, you can improve matching accuracy and protect data security while minimizing data movement because it reads records where they already live. Let’s see how that works in practice.\\nUsing AWS Entity Resolution As part of my analytics platform, I have a comma-separated values\\xa0(CSV) file containing one million fictitious customers in an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket. These customers come from a loyalty program but can have applied through different channels (online, in store, by post), so it’s possible that multiple records relate to the same customer.\\nThis is the format of the data in the CSV file:\\n\\nloyalty_id, rewards_id, name_id, first_name, middle_initial, last_name, program_id, emp_property_nbr, reward_parent_id, loyalty_program_id, loyalty_program_desc, enrollment_dt, zip_code,country, country_code, address1, address2, address3, address4, city, state_code, state_name, email_address, phone_nbr, phone_type\\n\\nI use an AWS Glue crawler to automatically determine the content of the file and keep the metadata table updated in the data catalog so that it’s available for my analytics jobs. Now, I can use the same setup with AWS Entity Resolution.\\nIn the AWS Entity Resolution console, I choose Get started to see how to set up a matching workflow.\\n\\nTo create a matching workflow, I first need to define my data with a schema mapping.\\n\\nI choose Create schema mapping, enter a name and description, and select the option to import the schema from AWS Glue. I could also define a custom schema using a step-by-step flow or a JSON editor.\\n\\nI select the AWS Glue database and table from the two dropdowns to import columns and pre-populate the input fields.\\n\\nI select the Unique ID from the dropdown. The unique ID is the column that can distinctly reference each row of my data. In this case, it’s the loyalty_id\\xa0in the CSV file.\\n\\nI select the input fields that are going to be used for matching. In this case, I choose the columns from the dropdown that can be used to recognize if multiple records are related to the same customer. If some columns aren’t required for matching but are required in the output file, I can optionally add them as pass-through fields. I choose Next.\\n\\nI map the input fields to their input type and match key. In this way, AWS Entity Resolution knows how to use these fields to match similar records. To continue, I choose Next.\\n\\nNow, I use grouping to better organize the data I need to compare. For example, the First name, Middle name, and Last name input fields can be grouped together and compared as a Full name.\\n\\nI also create a group for the Address fields.\\n\\nI choose Next and review all configurations. Then, I choose Create schema mapping.\\nNow that I’ve created the schema mapping, I choose Matching workflows from the navigation pane and then Create matching workflow.\\n\\nI enter a name and a description. Then, to configure the input data, I select the AWS Glue database and table and the schema mapping.\\n\\nTo give the service access to the data, I select a service role that I configured previously. The service role gives access to the input and output S3 buckets and the AWS Glue database and table. If the input or output buckets are encrypted, the service role can also give access to the AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) keys needed to encrypt and decrypt the data. I choose Next.\\n\\nI have the option to use a rule-based or ML-powered matching method. Depending on the method, I can use a manual or automatic processing cadence to run the matching workflow job. For now, I select Machine learning matching and Manual for the Processing cadence, and then choose Next.\\n\\nI configure an S3 bucket as the output destination. Under Data format, I select Normalized data so that special characters and extra spaces are removed, and data is formatted to lowercase.\\n\\nI use the default Encryption settings. For Data output, I use the default so that all input fields are included. For security, I can hide fields to exclude them from output or hash fields I want to mask. I choose Next.\\nI review all settings and choose Create and run to complete the creation of the matching workflow and run the job for the first time.\\nAfter a few minutes, the job completes. According to this analysis, of the 1 million records, only 835 thousand are unique customers. I choose View output in Amazon S3 to download the output files.\\n\\nIn the output files, each record has the original unique ID (loyalty_id in this case) and a newly assigned MatchID. Matching records, related to the same customers, have the same MatchID. The ConfidenceLevel field describes the confidence that machine learning matching has that the corresponding records are actually a match.\\nI can now use this information to have a better understanding of customers who are subscribed to the loyalty program.\\nAvailability and Pricing AWS Entity Resolution\\xa0is generally available today in the following AWS Regions: US East (Ohio, N. Virginia), US West (Oregon), Asia Pacific (Seoul, Singapore, Sydney, Tokyo), and Europe (Frankfurt, Ireland, London).\\nWith AWS Entity Resolution, you pay only for what you use based on the number of source records processed by your workflows. Pricing doesn’t depend on the matching method, whether it’s machine learning or rule-based record matching. For more information, see AWS Entity Resolution pricing.\\nUsing AWS Entity Resolution, you gain a deeper understanding of how data is linked. That helps you deliver new insights, enhance decision making, and improve customer experiences based on a unified view of their records.\\nSimplify the way you match and link related records across applications, channels, and data stores with AWS Entity Resolution.\\n— Danilo\\n\\nP.S.

AWS customers are increasingly asking us how they can best take advantage of generative AI in their own businesses. Most have accumulated a wealth of domain-specific data (financial records, health records, genomic data, supply chain, and so on), which provides them with a unique and valuable perspective into their business and broader industry. This proprietary data can be an advantage and differentiator for your generative AI strategy.\\nAt the same time, many customers have also noticed the rise in popularity of vector datastores, or vector databases, used in generative AI applications, and are wondering how these solutions fit in their overall data strategy around generative AI applications. In this post, we describe the role of vector databases in generative AI applications, and how AWS solutions can help you harness the power of generative AI.\\nGenerative AI applications\\nAt the heart of every generative AI application is a large language model (LLM). An LLM is a machine learning (ML) model trained on a large body of content—such as all the content accessible on the internet. LLMs trained on vast amounts of publicly accessible data are considered foundational models (FMs). They can be adapted and fine-tuned for a wide range of use cases. Amazon SageMaker JumpStart provides a variety of pre-trained, open-source, and proprietary foundational models for you to build upon, such as Stability AI’s Text2Image model, which can generate photorealistic images using a text prompt, or Hugging Face’s Text2Text Flan T-5 model for text generation. Amazon Bedrock, the easiest way to build and scale generative AI applications with FMs, makes models from AI21 Labs, Anthropic, Stability AI, and Amazon Titan accessible via an API.\\nAlthough a generative AI application relying purely on an FM will have access to broad real-world knowledge, it needs to be customized to produce accurate results on topics that are domain specific or specialized. Also, hallucinations (results that lack accuracy but look correct with confidence) occur more frequently the more specialized the interaction is. So how can you customize your generative AI application for domain specificity?\\nAdding domain specificity using vector datastores\\nPrompt engineering (also referred to as in-context learning) may be the easiest way to ground your generative AI application in your domain-specific context and improve accuracy. Although it won’t completely eliminate hallucinations, this technique will scope down the spectrum of semantic meaning to your own domain.\\nAt its core, the FM infers the next token based on a set of input tokens. A token in this case refers to any element with semantic meaning, like a word or phrase in text generation. The more contextually relevant inputs you provide, the higher the likelihood that the next token inferred is also contextually relevant. The prompt you query the FM with contains the input tokens, plus as much contextually relevant data as possible.\\nThe contextual data typically comes from your internal databases or data lakes, the systems that host your domain-specific data. Although you can enrich the prompt by simply appending additional domain-specific data from these data stores, vector datastores help you engineer your prompts with semantically relevant inputs. This method is called Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). In practice, you will likely engineer a prompt with both contextually personalized data, like user profile information, and semantically similar data.\\nFor generative AI usage, your domain-specific data must be encoded as a set of elements, each expressed internally as a vector. The vector contains a set of numeric values across a set of dimensions (array of numbers). The following figure illustrates an example of transforming context data into semantic elements and then vectors.\\n\\nThese numeric values are used to map elements in relation to each other in a multi-dimensional vector space. When the vector elements are semantic (they represent a form of meaning), the proximity becomes an indicator for contextual relationship. Used in this way, such vectors are referred to as embeddings. For example, the semantic element for “Cheese” may be put in proximity to the semantic element for “Dairy” in a multi-dimensional space representing the data domain context of groceries or cooking. Depending on your specific domain context, a semantic element may be a word, phrase, sentence, paragraph, whole document, image, or something else entirely. You split your domain-specific dataset into meaningful elements that can be related to each other. For example, the following figure illustrates a simplified vector space for a context on cooking.\\n\\nAs a result, to produce the relevant context for the prompt, you need to query a database and find elements that are closely related to your inputs in the vector space. A vector datastore is a system that allows you to store and query vectors at scale, with efficient nearest neighbor query algorithms and appropriate indexes to improve data retrieval. Any database management system that has these vector-related capabilities can be a vector datastore. Many commonly used database systems offer these vector capabilities along with the rest of their functionality. One advantage of storing your domain-specific datasets in a database with vector capabilities is that your vectors will be located close to the source data. You can enrich vector data with additional metadata, without having to query external databases, and you can simplify your data processing pipelines.\\nTo help you get started with vector datastores quickly, today we announced the vector engine for Amazon OpenSearch Serverless, which provides a simple API for storing and querying billions of embeddings, once it becomes generally available. However, we think that in the fullness of time, all AWS databases will have vector capabilities, because that simplifies your operations and data integration. Additionally, the following options are available for more advanced vector datastore needs:\\n\\nAn Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL-Compatible Edition relational database, with the pgvector open-source vector similarity search extension\\nAmazon OpenSearch Service, a distributed search and analytics service, with the k-NN (k-nearest neighbor) plugin, and vector engine for Amazon OpenSearch Serverless\\nAn Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) for PostgreSQL relational database, with the pgvector extension\\n\\nEmbeddings should be stored close to your source data. As a result, where you store your data today, as well as familiarity with these database technologies, scale in terms of vector dimensions, number of embeddings, and performance needs will determine which option is right for you. Before we dive deeper into more specific guidance for these options, let’s first understand how RAG works and how you apply vector datastores in RAG.\\nUsing vector datastores for RAG\\nYou can use embeddings (vectors) to improve the accuracy of your generative AI application. The following diagram illustrates this data flow.\\n\\nYou take your domain-specific dataset (the right side of the preceding figure, depicted in blue), split it into semantic elements, and use the FM to compute the vectors for these semantic elements. Then you store these vectors in a vector datastore, which will enable you to perform similarity search.\\nIn your generative AI application (left side of the preceding figure, depicted in orange), you take the end-user-provided question, split it into semantic elements (tokenization) using the same algorithm that was used on your dataset, and query the vector datastore for the nearest neighbors in the vector space for the input elements. The store will provide you with contextually similar semantic elements that you then add to your engineered prompt. This process will further ground the LLM into your domain-specific context, increasing the likelihood that the LLM output is accurate and relevant to that context.\\nPerforming similarity searches in your vector datastore, in the critical path of end-users, uses concurrent read queries. Batch processes to populate the vector datastore with embeddings and keep up with data changes are mostly data writes to the vector datastore. Aspects of this usage pattern along with previously mentioned considerations, like familiarity and scale, determine which service—Aurora PostgreSQL-Compatible, OpenSearch Service, the vector engine for OpenSearch Serverless, or Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL—is right for you.\\nVector datastore considerations\\nThe usage pattern we described also leads to some unique and important considerations for vector datastores.\\nThe volume of domain-specific data you wish to use and the process you use to split up that data into semantic elements will determine the number of embeddings your vector datastore needs to support. As your domain-specific data grows and changes over time, your vector datastore also has to accommodate that growth. This has impact on indexing efficiency and performance at scale. It’s not uncommon for domain-specific datasets to result in hundreds of millions—even billions—of embeddings. You use a tokenizer to split the data, and the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) provides several general purpose tokenizers you can use. But you can use alternatives, too. Ultimately, the right tokenizer depends on what a semantic element in your domain-specific dataset is—as previously mentioned, it could be a word, phrase, paragraph of text, entire document, or any subdivision of your data that holds independent meaning.\\nThe number of dimensions for the embedding vectors is another important factor to consider. Different FMs produce vectors with different numbers of dimensions. For example, the all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model produces vectors with 384 dimensions, and Falcon-40B vectors have 8,192 dimensions. The more dimensions a vector has, the richer the context it can represent—up to a point. You will eventually see diminishing returns and increased query latency. This eventually leads to the curse of dimensionality (objects appear sparse and dissimilar). To perform semantic similarity searches, you generally need vectors with dense dimensionality, but you may need to reduce the dimensions of your embeddings for your database to handle such searches efficiently.\\nAnother consideration is whether you need exact similarity search results. Indexing capabilities in vector datastores will speed up similarity search considerably, but they will also use an approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) algorithm to produce results. ANN algorithms provide performance and memory efficiencies in exchange for accuracy. They can’t guarantee that they return the exact nearest neighbors every time.\\nFinally, consider data governance. Your domain-specific datasets likely contain highly sensitive data, such as personal data or intellectual property. With your vector datastore close to your existing domain-specific datasets, you can extend your access, quality, and security controls to your vector datastore, simplifying operations. In many cases, it won’t be feasible to strip away such sensitive data without affecting the semantic meaning of the data, which in turn reduces accuracy. Therefore, it’s important to understand and control the flow of your data through the systems that create, store, and query embeddings.\\nUsing Aurora PostgreSQL or Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL with pgvector\\nPgvector, an open-source, community-supported PostgreSQL extension, is available both in Aurora PostgreSQL and Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL. The extension expands PostgreSQL with a vector data type called vector, three query operators for similarity searching (Euclidian, negative inner product, and cosine distance), and the ivfflat (inverted file with stored vectors) indexing mechanism for vectors to perform faster approximate distance searches. Although you can store vectors with up to 16,000 dimensions, only 2,000 dimensions can be indexed to improve similarity search performance. In practice, customers tend to use embeddings with fewer dimensions. The post Building AI-powered search in PostgreSQL using Amazon SageMaker and pgvector is a great resource to dive deeper into this extension.\\nYou should strongly consider using Aurora PostgreSQL with the pgvector extension for your vector datastore if you are already heavily invested in relational databases, especially PostgreSQL, and have a lot of expertise in that space. Also, highly structured domain-specific datasets are a more natural fit for relational databases. Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL can also be a great choice if you need to use specific community versions of PostgreSQL. Similarity search queries (reads) can also scale horizontally subject to the maximum number of read replicas supported by Aurora in a single DB cluster (15) and Amazon RDS in a replication chain (15).\\nAurora PostgreSQL also supports Amazon Aurora Serverless v2, an on-demand, auto scaling configuration that can adjust the compute and memory capacity of your DB instances automatically based on load. This configuration simplifies operations because you no longer have to provision for peak or perform complex capacity planning in most use cases.\\nAmazon Aurora Machine Learning (Aurora ML) is a feature you can use to make calls to ML models hosted in Amazon SageMaker via SQL functions. You can use it to make calls to your FMs to generate embeddings directly from your database. You can package these calls into stored procedures or integrate them with other PostgreSQL capabilities, such that the vectorization process is completely abstracted away from the application. With the batching capabilities built into Aurora ML, you may not even need to export the initial dataset from Aurora in order to transform it to create the initial set of vectors.\\nUsing OpenSearch Service with the k-NN plugin and the vector engine for OpenSearch Serverless\\nThe k-NN plugin expands OpenSearch, an open-source, distributed search and analytics suite, with the custom knn_vector data type, enabling you to store embeddings in OpenSearch indexes. The plugin also provides three methods to perform k-nearest neighbor similarity searches: Approximate k-NN, Script Score k-NN (exact), and the Painless extensions (exact). OpenSearch includes the Non-Metric Space Library (NMSLIB) and Facebook AI Research’s FAISS library. You can use different search algorithms for distance to find the best one that meets your needs. This plugin is also available in OpenSearch Service, and the post Amazon OpenSearch Service’s vector database capabilities explained is a great resource to dive deeper into these features.\\nDue to the distributed nature of OpenSearch, it’s a great choice for vector datastores with a very large number of embeddings. Your indexes scale horizontally, allowing you to handle more throughput for storing embeddings and performing similarity searches. It’s also a great choice for customers who want to have deeper control over the method and algorithms used to perform searches. Search engines are designed for low-latency, high throughput querying, trading off transactional behavior to achieve that.\\nOpenSearch Serverless is an on-demand serverless configuration that removes the operational complexities of provisioning, configuring, and tuning OpenSearch domains. You simply start by creating a collection of indexes and start populating your index data. The newly announced vector engine for OpenSearch Serverless is offered as a new vector collection type, along with search and time series collections. It gives you an easy way to get started working with vector similarity search. It provides an easy-to-operate pairing for Amazon Bedrock to integrate prompt engineering into your generative AI applications, without needing advanced expertise in ML or vector technology. With the vector engine, you’re able to query vector embeddings, metadata, and descriptive text easily within a single API call, resulting in more accurate search results while reducing complexity in your application stack.\\nVectors in OpenSearch with the k-NN plugin support up to 16,000 dimensions when using the nmslib and faiss engines, and 1,024 dimensions with the Lucene engine. Lucene provides the core search and analytics capabilities of OpenSearch, along with vector search. OpenSearch uses a custom REST API for most operations, including similarity searches. It enables greater flexibility when interacting with OpenSearch indexes, while allowing you to reuse skills for building distributed web-based applications.\\nOpenSearch is also a great option if you need to combine semantic similarity search with keyword search use cases. Prompt engineering for generative AI applications involves both retrieval of contextual data and RAG. For example, a customer support agent application may build a prompt by including previous support cases with the same keywords, as well as support cases that are semantically similar, so the recommended solution is grounded in the appropriate context.\\nThe Neural Search plugin (experimental) enables the integration of ML language models directly into your OpenSearch workflows. With this plugin, OpenSearch automatically creates vectors for the text provided during ingestion and search. It then seamlessly uses the vectors for search queries. This can simplify similarity search tasks used in RAG.\\nAdditionally, if you prefer a fully managed semantic search experience on domain-specific data, you should consider Amazon Kendra. It provides out-of-the-box semantic search capabilities for state-of-the-art ranking of documents and passages, eliminating the overhead of managing text extraction, passage splitting, getting embeddings, and managing vector datastores. You can use Amazon Kendra for your semantic search needs and package the results into your engineered prompt, thereby maximizing the benefits of RAG with the least amount of operational overhead. The post Quickly build high-accuracy Generative AI applications on enterprise data using Amazon Kendra, LangChain, and large language models provides deeper guidance for this use case.\\nFinally, Aurora PostgreSQL and Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL with pgvector, the vector engine for OpenSearch Serverless, and OpenSearch Service with k-NN are supported in LangChain. LangChain is a popular Python framework for developing data-aware, agent-style applications based on LLMs.\\nSummary\\nEmbeddings should be stored and managed close to your domain-specific datasets. Doing so allows you to combine them with additional metadata without using additional, external data sources. Your data is also not static, but changes over time, and storing the embeddings near your source data simplifies your data pipelines for keeping the embeddings up to date.\\nAurora PostgreSQL and Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL with pgvector, as well as the vector engine for OpenSearch Serverless and OpenSearch Service with the k-NN plugin, are great choices for your vector datastore needs, but which solution is right for you will ultimately depend on your use case and priorities. If your database of choice doesn’t have vector capabilities, the options discussed in this post span the spectrum of familiarity with SQL and NoSQL and are straightforward to pick up without a lot of operational overhead. No matter which option you choose, your vector datastore solution needs to sustain the concurrent throughput dispatched by the application. Validate your solution at scale with a full set of embeddings, so the similarity search response latencies meet your expectations.\\nAt the same time, prompt engineering used in conjunction with foundational models provided by SageMaker JumpStart and Amazon Bedrock will enable you to build innovative generative AI solutions to delight your customers, without having to invest in significant ML skills.\\nOn a final note, keep in mind technology is evolving rapidly in this space, and although we will make every effort to update our guidance as things change, the recommendations in this post may not be universally applicable.\\nGet started building generative AI applications on AWS today!

The vector engine provides a simple, scalable, and high-performing similarity search capability in Amazon OpenSearch Serverless that makes it easy for you to build modern machine learning (ML) augmented search experiences and generative artificial intelligence (AI) applications without having to manage the underlying vector database infrastructure. This post summarizes the features and functionalities of our vector engine.\\nUsing augmented ML search and generative AI with vector embeddings\\nOrganizations across all verticals are rapidly adopting generative AI for its ability to handle vast datasets, generate automated content, and provide interactive, human-like responses. Customers are exploring ways to transform the end-user experience and interaction with their digital platform by integrating advanced conversational generative AI applications such as chatbots, question and answer systems, and personalized recommendations. These conversational applications enable you to search and query in natural language and generate responses that closely resemble human-like responses by accounting for the semantic meaning, user intent, and query context.\\nML-augmented search applications and generative AI applications use vector embeddings, which are numerical representations of text, image, audio, and video data to generate dynamic and relevant content. The vector embeddings are trained on your private data and represent the semantic and contextual attributes of the information. Ideally, these embeddings can be stored and managed close to your domain-specific datasets, such as within your existing search engine or database. This enables you to process a user’s query to find the closest vectors and combine them with additional metadata without relying on external data sources or additional application code to integrate the results. Customers want a vector database option that is simple to build on and enables them to move quickly from prototyping to production so they can focus on creating differentiated applications. The vector engine for OpenSearch Serverless extends OpenSearch’s search capabilities by enabling you to store, search, and retrieve billions of vector embeddings in real time and perform accurate similarity matching and semantic searches without having to think about the underlying infrastructure.\\nExploring the vector engine’s capabilities\\nBuilt on OpenSearch Serverless, the vector engine inherits and benefits from its robust architecture. With the vector engine, you don’t have to worry about sizing, tuning, and scaling the backend infrastructure. The vector engine automatically adjusts resources by adapting to changing workload patterns and demand to provide consistently fast performance and scale. As the number of vectors grows from a few thousand during prototyping to hundreds of millions and beyond in production, the vector engine will scale seamlessly, without the need for reindexing or reloading your data to scale your infrastructure. Additionally, the vector engine has separate compute for indexing and search workloads, so you can seamlessly ingest, update, and delete vectors in real time while ensuring that the query performance your users experience remains unaffected. All the data is persisted in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), so you get the same data durability guarantees as Amazon S3 (eleven nines). Even though we are still in preview, the vector engine is designed for production workloads with redundancy for Availability Zone outages and infrastructure failures.\\nThe vector engine for OpenSearch Serverless is powered by the k-nearest neighbor (kNN) search feature in the open-source OpenSearch Project, proven to deliver reliable and precise results. Many customers today are using OpenSearch kNN search in managed clusters for offering semantic search and personalization in their applications. With the vector engine, you can get the same functionality with the simplicity of a serverless environment. The vector engine supports the popular distance metrics such as Euclidean, cosine similarity, and dot product, and can accommodate 16,000 dimensions, making it well-suited to support a wide range of foundational and other AI/ML models. You can also store diverse fields with various data types such as numeric, boolean, date, keyword, geopoint for metadata, and text for descriptive information to add more context to the stored vectors. Colocating the data types reduces the complexity and maintainability and avoids data duplication, version compatibility challenges, and licensing issues, effectively simplifying your application stack. Because the vector engine supports the same OpenSearch open-source suite APIs, you can take advantage of its rich query capabilities, such as full text search, advanced filtering, aggregations, geo-spatial query, nested queries for faster retrieval of data, and enhanced search results. For example, if your use case requires you to find the results within 15 miles of the requestor, the vector engine can do this in a single query, eliminating the need for maintaining two different systems and then combining the results through application logic. With support for integration with LangChain, Amazon Bedrock, and Amazon SageMaker, you can easily integrate your preferred ML and AI system with the vector engine.\\nThe vector engine supports a wide range of use cases across various domains, including image search, document search, music retrieval, product recommendation, video search, location-based search, fraud detection, and anomaly detection. We also anticipate a growing trend for hybrid searches that combine lexical search methods with advanced ML and generative AI capabilities. For example, when a user searches for a “red shirt” on your e-commerce website, semantic search helps expand the scope by retrieving all shades of red, while preserving the tuning and boosting logic implemented on the lexical (BM25) search. With OpenSearch filtering, you can further enhance the relevance of your search results by providing users with options to refine their search based on size, brand, price range, and availability in nearby stores, allowing for a more personalized and precise experience. The hybrid search support in the vector engine enables you to query vector embeddings, metadata, and descriptive information within a single query call, making it easy to provide more accurate and contextually relevant search results without building complex application code.\\nYou can get started in minutes with the vector engine by creating a specialized vector search collection under OpenSearch Serverless using the AWS Management Console, AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), or the AWS software development kit (AWS SDK). Collections are a logical grouping of indexed data that works together to support a workload, while the physical resources are automatically managed in the backend. You don’t have to declare how much compute or storage is needed or monitor the system to make sure it’s running well. OpenSearch Serverless applies different sharding and indexing strategies for the three available collection types: time series, search, and vector search. The vector engine’s compute capacity used for data ingestion, and search and query are measured in OpenSearch Compute Units (OCUs). One OCU can handle 4 million vectors for 128 dimensions or 500K for 768 dimensions at 99% recall rate.\\xa0The vector engine is built on OpenSearch Serverless, which is a highly available service and requires a minimum of 4 OCUs (two OCUs for the ingest including primary and standby, and two OCUs for the search with two active replicas across Availability Zones) for that first collection in an account. All subsequent collections using the same AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) key can share those OCUs.\\nGet started with vector embeddings\\nTo get started using vector embeddings using the console, complete the following steps:\\n\\nCreate a new collection on the OpenSearch Serverless console.\\nProvide a name and optional description.\\nCurrently, vector embeddings are supported exclusively by vector search collections; therefore, for Collection type, select Vector search.\\nNext, you must configure the security policies, which includes encryption, network, and data access policies.\\n\\nWe are introducing the new Easy create option, which streamlines the security configuration for faster onboarding. All the data in the vector engine is encrypted in transit and at rest by default. You can choose to bring your own encryption key or use the one provided by the service that is dedicated for your collection or account. You can choose to host your collection on a public endpoint or within a VPC. The vector engine supports fine-grained AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) permissions so that you can define who can create, update, and delete encryption, network, collections, and indexes, thereby enabling organizational alignment.\\n\\n\\nWith the security settings in place, you can finish creating the collection.\\n\\nAfter the collection is successfully created, you can create the vector index. At this point, you can use the API or the console to create an index. An index is a collection of documents with a common data schema and provides a way for you to store, search, and retrieve your vector embeddings and other fields. The vector index supports up to 1,000 fields.\\n\\nTo create the vector index, you must define the vector field name, dimensions, and the distance metric.\\n\\nThe vector index supports up to 16,000 dimensions and three types of distance metrics: Euclidean, cosine, and dot product.\\n\\nOnce you have successfully created the index, you can use OpenSearch’s powerful query capabilities to get comprehensive search results.\\nThe following example shows how easily you can create a simple property listing index with the title, description, price, and location details as fields using the OpenSearch API. By using the query APIs, this index can efficiently provide accurate results to match your search requests, such as “Find me a two-bedroom apartment in Seattle that is under $3000.”\\n\\nFrom preview to GA and beyond\\nToday, we are excited to announce the preview of the vector engine, making it available for you to begin testing it out immediately. As we noted earlier, OpenSearch Serverless was designed to provide a highly available service to power your enterprise applications, with independent compute resources for index and search and built-in redundancy.\\nWe recognize that many of you are in the experimentation phase and would like a more economical option for dev-test. Prior to GA, we plan to offer two features that will enable us to reduce the cost of your first collection. The first is a new dev-test option that enables you to launch a collection with no active standby or replica, reducing the entry cost by 50%. The vector engine still provides durability guarantees because it persists all the data in Amazon S3. The second is to initially provision a 0.5 OCU footprint, which will scale up as needed to support your workload, further lowering costs if your initial workload is in the tens of thousands to low-hundreds of thousands of vectors (depending on the number of dimensions). Between these two features, we will reduce the minimum OCUs needed to power your first collection from 4 OCUs down to 1 OCU per hour.\\nWe are also working on features that will allow us to achieve workload pause and resume capabilities in the coming months, which is particularly useful for the vector engine because many of these use cases don’t require continuous indexing of the data.\\nLastly, we are diligently focused on optimizing the performance and memory usage of the vector graphs, including improving caching, merging and more.\\nWhile we work on these cost reductions, we will be offering the first 1400 OCU-hours per month free on vector collections until the dev-test option is made available. This will enable you to test the vector engine preview for up to two weeks every month at no cost, based on your workload.\\nSummary\\nThe vector engine for OpenSearch Serverless introduces a simple, scalable, and high-performing vector storage and search capability that makes it straightforward for you to quickly store and query billions of vector embeddings generated from a variety of ML models, such as those provided by Amazon Bedrock, with response times in milliseconds.\\nThe preview release of vector engine for OpenSearch Serverless is now available in eight Regions globally: US East (Ohio), US East (N. Virginia), US West (Oregon), Asia Pacific (Singapore), Asia Pacific (Sydney), Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Europe (Frankfurt), and Europe (Ireland).\\nWe are the excited about the future ahead and your feedback will play a vital role in guiding the progress of this product. We encourage you to try out the vector engine for OpenSearch Serverless and share your use cases, questions, and feedback in the comments section.\\nIn the coming weeks, we will be publishing a series of posts to provide you with detailed guidance on how to integrate the vector engine with LangChain, Amazon Bedrock, and SageMaker.

Integrating data from different sources can be a complex and time-consuming process. AWS offers AWS Glue to help you integrate your data from multiple sources on serverless infrastructure for analysis, machine learning (ML), and application development. AWS Glue provides different authoring experiences for you to build data integration jobs. One of the most common options is the notebook. Data scientists tend to run queries interactively and retrieve results immediately to author data integration jobs. This interactive experience can accelerate building data integration pipelines.\\nRecently, AWS announced general availability of Amazon CodeWhisperer. Amazon CodeWhisperer is an AI coding companion that uses foundational models under the hood to improve developer productivity. This works by generating code suggestions in real time based on developers’ comments in natural language and prior code in their integrated development environment (IDE). AWS also announced the Amazon CodeWhisperer Jupyter extension to help Jupyter users by generating real-time, single-line, or full-function code suggestions for Python notebooks on Jupyter Lab and Amazon SageMaker Studio.\\nToday, we are excited to announce that AWS Glue Studio notebooks now support Amazon CodeWhisperer for AWS Glue users to improve your experience and help boost development productivity. Now, in your Glue Studio notebook, you can write a comment in natural language (in English) that outlines a specific task, such as “Create a Spark DataFrame from a json file.”. Based on this information, CodeWhisperer recommends one or more code snippets directly in the notebook that can accomplish the task. You can quickly accept the top suggestion, view more suggestions, or continue writing your own code.\\n\\nThis post demonstrates how the user experience on AWS Glue Studio notebook has been changed with the Amazon CodeWhisperer integration.\\nPrerequisites\\nBefore going forward with this tutorial, you need to complete the following prerequisites:\\n\\nSet up AWS Glue Studio.\\nConfigure an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role to interact with Amazon CodeWhisperer. Attach the following policy to your IAM role for the AWS Glue Studio notebook: \\n \\n{\\n\"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\\n\"Statement\": [\\n{\\n\"Sid\": \"CodeWhispererPermissions\",\\n\"Effect\": \"Allow\",\\n\"Action\": [\\n\"codewhisperer:GenerateRecommendations\"\\n],\\n\"Resource\": \"*\"\\n}\\n]\\n}\\n \\n\\nGetting Started\\nLet’s get started. Create a new AWS Glue Studio notebook job by completing the following steps:\\n\\nOn the AWS Glue console, choose Notebooks under ETL jobs in the navigation pane.\\nSelect Jupyter Notebook and choose Create.\\nFor Job name, enter codewhisperer-demo.\\nFor IAM Role, select your IAM role that you configured as a prerequisite.\\nChoose Start notebook.\\n\\nA new notebook is created with sample cells.\\n\\nAt the bottom, there is a menu named CodeWhisperer. By choosing this menu, you can see the shortcuts and several options, including disabling auto-suggestions.\\n\\nLet’s try your first recommendation by Amazon CodeWhisperer. Note that this post contains examples of recommendations, but you may see different code snippets recommended by Amazon CodeWhisperer.\\nAdd a new cell and enter your comment to describe what you want to achieve. After you press Enter, the recommended code is shown.\\n\\nIf you press Tab, then code is chosen. If you press arrow keys, then you can select other recommendations. You can learn more in User actions.\\nNow let’s read a JSON file from Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). Enter the following code comment into a notebook cell and press Enter:\\n\\n# Create a Spark DataFrame from a json file\\n\\nCodeWhisperer will recommend a code snippet similar to the following:\\n\\ndef create_spark_df_from_json(spark, file_path):\\nreturn spark.read.json(file_path)\\n\\nNow use this method to utilize the suggested code snippet:\\n\\ndf = create_spark_df_from_json(spark, \"s3://awsglue-datasets/examples/us-legislators/all/persons.json\")\\ndf.show()\\n\\nThe proceeding code returns the following output:\\n\\n+----------+--------------------+----------+-----------+------+----------+--------------------+--------------------+--------------------+--------------------+--------------------+------------------+--------------------+----------------+\\n|birth_date| contact_details|death_date|family_name|gender|given_name|id| identifiers| image|images| links|name| other_names| sort_name|\\n+----------+--------------------+----------+-----------+------+----------+--------------------+--------------------+--------------------+--------------------+--------------------+------------------+--------------------+----------------+\\n|1944-10-15|null|null|Collins|male| Michael|0005af3a-9471-4d1...|[{C000640, biogui...|https://theunited...|[{https://theunit...|[{Wikipedia (de),...| Mac Collins|[{bar, Mac Collin...|Collins, Michael|\\n|1969-01-31|[{fax, 202-226-07...|null| Huizenga|male|Bill|00aa2dc0-bfb6-441...|[{Bill Huizenga, ...|https://theunited...|[{https://theunit...|[{Wikipedia (de),...| Bill Huizenga|[{da, Bill Huizen...|Huizenga, Bill|\\n|1959-09-28|[{phone, 202-225-...|null|Clawson|male|Curtis|00aca284-9323-495...|[{C001102, biogui...|https://theunited...|[{https://theunit...|[{Wikipedia (comm...|Curt Clawson|[{bar, Curt Claws...| Clawson, Curtis|\\n|1930-08-14|null|2001-10-26|Solomon|male|Gerald|00b73df5-4180-441...|[{S000675, biogui...|https://theunited...|[{https://theunit...|[{Wikipedia (de),...|Gerald Solomon|[{null, Gerald B....| Solomon, Gerald|\\n|1960-05-28|[{fax, 202-225-42...|null| Rigell|male|Edward|00bee44f-db04-4a7...|[{R000589, biogui...|https://theunited...|[{https://theunit...|[{Wikipedia (de),...| E.

When death_date is not null, then use death_date to calculate age\\n\\nAmazon CodeWhisperer will recommend a code snippet similar to the following:\\n\\ndef add_age_column(df):\\n# Use current date to calculate age\\ncurrent_date = current_timestamp()\\n# Use birth_date column to calculate age\\ndf = df.withColumn(\"age\", datediff(current_date, df.birth_date) / 365)\\n# Use death_date column to calculate age\\ndf = df.withColumn(\"age\", when(df.death_date.isNull(), df.age).otherwise(datediff(df.death_date, df.birth_date) / 365))\\nreturn df\\n\\nIt can be utilized as follows:\\n\\ndf = add_age_column(df)\\ndf.show()\\n\\nThe preceding code returns the following output:\\n\\n+----------+--------------------+----------+-----------+------+----------+--------------------+--------------------+--------------------+--------------------+--------------------+------------------+--------------------+----------------+------------------+--------------------+\\n|birth_date| contact_details|death_date|family_name|gender|given_name|id| identifiers| image|images| links|name| other_names| sort_name| age|current_date|\\n+----------+--------------------+----------+-----------+------+----------+--------------------+--------------------+--------------------+--------------------+--------------------+------------------+--------------------+----------------+------------------+--------------------+\\n|1944-10-15|null|null|Collins|male| Michael|0005af3a-9471-4d1...|[{C000640, biogui...|https://theunited...|[{https://theunit...|[{Wikipedia (de),...| Mac Collins|[{bar, Mac Collin...|Collins, Michael| 78.71506849315068|2023-06-14 06:12:...|\\n|1969-01-31|[{fax, 202-226-07...|null| Huizenga|male|Bill|00aa2dc0-bfb6-441...|[{Bill Huizenga, ...|https://theunited...|[{https://theunit...|[{Wikipedia (de),...| Bill Huizenga|[{da, Bill Huizen...|Huizenga, Bill|54.4027397260274|2023-06-14 06:12:...|\\n|1959-09-28|[{phone, 202-225-...|null|Clawson|male|Curtis|00aca284-9323-495...|[{C001102, biogui...|https://theunited...|[{https://theunit...|[{Wikipedia (comm...|Curt Clawson|[{bar, Curt Claws...| Clawson, Curtis| 63.75342465753425|2023-06-14 06:12:...|\\n|1930-08-14|null|2001-10-26|Solomon|male|Gerald|00b73df5-4180-441...|[{S000675, biogui...|https://theunited...|[{https://theunit...|[{Wikipedia (de),...|Gerald Solomon|[{null, Gerald B....| Solomon, Gerald| 71.24931506849315|2023-06-14 06:12:...|\\n|1960-05-28|[{fax, 202-225-42...|null| Rigell|male|Edward|00bee44f-db04-4a7...|[{R000589, biogui...|https://theunited...|[{https://theunit...|[{Wikipedia (de),...| E.

This announcement is the product of more than a decade of collaboration between AWS and NVIDIA, delivering the visual computing, AI, and high performance computing (HPC) clusters across the Cluster GPU (cg1) instances (2010), G2 (2013), P2 (2016), P3 (2017), G3 (2017), P3dn (2018), G4 (2019), P4 (2020), G5 (2021), and P4de instances (2022).\\nMost notably, ML model sizes are now reaching trillions of parameters. But this complexity has increased customers’ time to train, where the latest LLMs are now trained over the course of multiple months. HPC customers also exhibit similar trends. With the fidelity of HPC customer data collection increasing and data sets reaching exabyte scale, customers are looking for ways to enable faster time to solution across increasingly complex applications.\\nIntroducing EC2 P5 Instances Today, we are announcing the general availability of Amazon EC2 P5 instances, the next-generation GPU instances to address those customer needs for high performance and scalability in AI/ML and HPC workloads. P5 instances are powered by the latest NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs and will provide a reduction of up to 6 times in training time (from days to hours) compared to previous generation GPU-based instances. This performance increase will enable customers to see up to 40 percent lower training costs.\\nP5 instances provide 8 x NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs with 640 GB of high bandwidth GPU memory, 3rd Gen AMD EPYC processors, 2 TB of system memory, and 30 TB of local NVMe storage. P5 instances also provide 3200 Gbps of aggregate network bandwidth with support for GPUDirect RDMA, enabling lower latency and efficient scale-out performance by bypassing the CPU on internode communication.\\nHere is the specs for this instance:\\n\\n\\n\\nInstance Size\\nvCPUs\\nMemory (GiB)\\nGPUs (H100)\\nNetwork Bandwidth (Gbps)\\nEBS Bandwidth (Gbps)\\nLocal Storage (TB)\\n\\n\\np5.48xlarge\\n192\\n2048\\n8\\n3200\\n80\\n8 x 3.84\\n\\n\\n\\nHere’s a quick infographic that shows you how the P5 instances and NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs compare to previous instances and processors:\\n\\nP5 instances are ideal for training and running inference for increasingly complex LLMs and computer vision models behind the most demanding and compute-intensive generative AI applications, including question answering, code generation, video and image generation, speech recognition, and more. P5 will provide up to 6 times lower time to train compared with previous generation GPU-based instances across those applications. Customers who can use lower precision FP8 data types in their workloads, common in many language models that use a transformer model backbone, will see further benefit at up to 6 times performance increase through support for the NVIDIA Transformer Engine.\\nHPC customers using P5 instances can deploy demanding applications at greater scale in pharmaceutical discovery, seismic analysis, weather forecasting, and financial modeling. Customers using dynamic programming (DP) algorithms for applications like genome sequencing or accelerated data analytics will also see further benefit from P5 through support for a new DPX instruction set.\\nThis enables customers to explore problem spaces that previously seemed unreachable, iterate on their solutions at a faster clip, and get to market more quickly.\\nYou can see the detail of instance specifications along with comparisons of instance types between p4d.24xlarge and new p5.48xlarge below:\\n\\n\\n\\nFeature\\np4d.24xlarge\\np5.48xlarge\\nComparison\\n\\n\\nNumber & Type of Accelerators\\n8 x NVIDIA A100\\n8 x NVIDIA H100\\n–\\n\\n\\nFP8 TFLOPS per Server\\n–\\n16,000\\n6.4x vs.A100 FP16\\n\\n\\nFP16 TFLOPS per Server\\n2,496\\n8,000\\n\\n\\nGPU Memory\\n40 GB\\n80 GB\\n2x\\n\\n\\nGPU Memory Bandwidth\\n12.8 TB/s\\n26.8 TB/s\\n2x\\n\\n\\nCPU Family\\nIntel Cascade Lake\\nAMD Milan\\n–\\n\\n\\nvCPUs\\n96\\n\\xa0192\\n2x\\n\\n\\nTotal System Memory\\n1152 GB\\n2048 GB\\n2x\\n\\n\\nNetworking Throughput\\n400 Gbps\\n3200 Gbps\\n8x\\n\\n\\nEBS Throughput\\n19 Gbps\\n80 Gbps\\n4x\\n\\n\\nLocal Instance Storage\\n8 TBs NVMe\\n30 TBs NVMe\\n3.75x\\n\\n\\nGPU to GPU Interconnect\\n600 GB/s\\n900 GB/s\\n1.5x\\n\\n\\n\\nSecond-generation Amazon EC2 UltraClusters and Elastic Fabric Adaptor P5 instances provide market-leading scale-out capability for multi-node distributed training and tightly coupled HPC workloads. They offer up to 3,200 Gbps of networking using the second-generation Elastic Fabric Adaptor (EFA) technology, 8 times compared with P4d instances.\\nTo address customer needs for large-scale and low latency, P5 instances are deployed in the second-generation EC2 UltraClusters, which now provide customers with lower latency across up to 20,000+ NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs. Providing the largest scale of ML infrastructure in the cloud, P5 instances in EC2 UltraClusters deliver up to 20 exaflops of aggregate compute capability.\\n\\nEC2 UltraClusters use Amazon FSx for Lustre, fully managed shared storage built on the most popular high-performance parallel file system. With FSx for Lustre, you can quickly process massive datasets on demand and at scale and deliver sub-millisecond latencies. The low-latency and high-throughput characteristics of FSx for Lustre are optimized for deep learning, generative AI, and HPC workloads on EC2 UltraClusters.\\nFSx for Lustre keeps the GPUs and ML accelerators in EC2 UltraClusters fed with data, accelerating the most demanding workloads. These workloads include LLM training, generative AI inferencing, and HPC workloads, such as genomics and financial risk modeling.\\nGetting Started with EC2 P5 Instances To get started, you can use P5 instances in the US East (N. Virginia) and US West (Oregon) Region.\\n\\nWhen launching P5 instances, you will choose AWS Deep Learning AMIs (DLAMIs) to support P5 instances. DLAMI provides ML practitioners and researchers with the infrastructure and tools to quickly build scalable, secure distributed ML applications in preconfigured environments.\\nYou will be able to run containerized applications on P5 instances with AWS Deep Learning Containers using libraries for Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) or Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service \\xa0(Amazon EKS). \\xa0For a more managed experience, you can also use P5 instances via Amazon SageMaker, which helps developers and data scientists easily scale to tens, hundreds, or thousands of GPUs to train a model quickly at any scale without worrying about setting up clusters and data pipelines. HPC customers can leverage AWS Batch and ParallelCluster with P5 to help orchestrate jobs and clusters efficiently.\\nExisting P4 customers will need to update their AMIs to use P5 instances. Specifically, you will need to update your AMIs to include the latest NVIDIA driver with support for NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs. They will also need to install the latest CUDA version (CUDA 12), CuDNN version, framework versions (e.g., PyTorch, Tensorflow), and EFA driver with updated topology files. To make this process easy for you, we will provide new DLAMIs and Deep Learning Containers that come prepackaged with all the needed software and frameworks to use P5 instances out of the box.\\nNow Available Amazon EC2 P5 instances are available today in AWS Regions: US East (N. Virginia) and US West (Oregon). For more information, see the Amazon EC2 pricing page. To learn more, see EC2 P5 instance page and send feedback to AWS re:Post for EC2 or through your usual AWS Support contacts.\\nYou can choose a broad range of AWS services that have generative AI built in, all running on the most cost-effective cloud infrastructure for generative AI.

    "In conclusion, this blog post delves into the critical process of infusing domain-specific knowledge into large language models (LLMs) like LLaMA2, emphasizing the importance of addressing challenges related to helpfulness, honesty, and harmlessness when designing LLM-powered applications for enterprise-grade quality. The primary focus here is on the parametric approach to fine-tuning, which efficiently injects niche expertise into foundation models without compromising their general linguistic capabilities.The blog highlights the steps involved in fine-tuning LLaMA2 using parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques, such as the qLoRA approach, and how this process can be conducted on Amazon SageMaker. By adopting this approach, practitioners can adapt LLaMA2 to specific domains, ensuring that the models remain up-to-date with recent knowledge even beyond their original training data. The article also underscores the versatility of this approach, showing that it can be applied to models like LLaMA2-chat, which have already undergone task-specific fine-tuning. This opens up opportunities to infuse knowledge into LLMs without the need for extensive instruction or chat-based fine-tuning, preserving their task-specific nature.\n",
